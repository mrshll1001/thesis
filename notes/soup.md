Fox discusses accountability in terms of \quoteit{the capacity or right to demand answers} or the \quoteit{capacity to sanction}, whereas transparency concerns itself with the public's right and ability to access information; and whilst common wisdom dictates that transparency generates accountability, this assumption is challenged when held to scrutiny \cite{fox_uncertain_2007}. Fox's analysis of transparency divides it into two categories -- \textit{clear transparency} and \textit{opaque} or \textit{fuzzy transparency} -- which closely resemble Schauer and Oliver's definitions of the \textit{Active} or \textit{New Transparency} and the \textit{Passive} or \textit{Old Transparency} \cite{schauer_transparency_2011, oliver_what_2004, fox_uncertain_2007}. Fox argues the importance of this distinction lies in the fact that as Transparency becomes an increasingly desirable term, opponents will express their dissent through provision of \textit{fuzzy transparency}. This is data which lacks information that can reveal organisational behaviour and thus cannot be used to generate accountability \cite{fox_uncertain_2007}.

The \textit{Clear Transparency} alluded to by Fox is defined as \quoteit{information-access policies [and] programmes that reveal reliable information about institutional performance, specifying officials' responsibilities [and] where public funds go}. Importantly, though \textit{Clear Transparency} is concerned with organisational behaviour, it is not sufficient to generate accountability -- which requires the intervention of other actors \cite{fox_uncertain_2007}. Accountability is also explained by Fox as either \textit{Soft Accountability} (the ability to demand answers) and \textit{Hard Accountability} (the ability to issue sanctions). Fox stipulates that appropriate levels of \textit{Clear Transparency} gives the public the ability to perceive problems, and to demand answers -- which is a form of \textit{Soft Accountability} known as \textit{answerability} \cite{fox_uncertain_2007}. Further forms of accountability are founded on the ability to not only reveal existing data, but to investigate and produce information about organisational behaviour \cite{fox_uncertain_2007}.

AHNEIER AND HAWKES STUFF This discussion, whilst focusing on the difficulty of regulating accountability across national borders, has insight into the ways that transparency mechanisms may not be adequate for generating true accountability in NPOs. They highlight how it is often media companies that reveal `unethical behaviour' to the public, rather than formal auditing bodies -- an example from the UK would be how the NPO \textit{Kid's Company} experienced negative media coverage over their closure relating to alleged misuse of funds \cite{elgot_kids_2015, anheier_accountability_2009}. Anheir and Hawkes also draw on Koppel's `Five Dimensions of Accountability' framework -- which imbues Accountability with a five-part typology: \textit{transparency}; \textit{liability}; \textit{controllability}; \textit{responsibility}; and \textit{responsiveness} \cite{anheier_accountability_2009, koppell_pathologies_2005}.

The remaining three dimensions of Koppell's typology: \textit{controllability}; \textit{responsibility}; and \textit{responsiveness} are all built upon the foundations of Transparency and Liability. \textit{Controllability} is a form of accountability where if \quoteit{X can induce the behaviour of Y [then] X controls Y [and] Y is accountable to X} \cite{koppell_pathologies_2005}. Koppell notes that \textit{Controllability} can be difficult in organisations that have multiple stakeholders to whom the organisation is supposed to be controlled by \citep{koppell_pathologies_2005}, though is also unclear when describing the physical mechanisms by which an organisation may be controlled by other stakeholders. Romzek and Dubnick's description of systems such as internal \textit{Bureaucratic} and external \textit{Legal} systems, as well as \textit{Political} responsiveness, being utilised to control an organisation \cite{romzek_accountability_1987} would indicate that mechanisms which produce \textit{Controllability} are situated within the \textit{Responsibility} and \textit{Responsiveness} areas of the typology. \textit{Responsibility} denotes the constraint of behaviour through laws, rules, or norms such as legal frameworks or professional standards of conduct \cite{romzek_accountability_1987, koppell_pathologies_2005}.
