# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Background and Context
Section outlining broad thesis goals

### Why accounting technologies?
This section outlines why the focus of this thesis has been in investigating and developing accounting technologies, and how that situates the research in relation to the scope of impact.

## Research Questions and contributions
This section outlines each research question, with sub-sections for each question. Each sub-section will draw out the contributions of the thesis as they relate to the question.

### Q1: How are the financial practices and transparency obligations of a charity manifested in daily workplace practices?

### Q2: In what ways could digital systems represent the financial practices of a charity, in keeping with their obligations to the public and their stakeholders?

### Q3: How can a system capture and represent the work of a charity through its financial data and other data, in order to facilitate its accountability to the public and its stakeholders?

### Q4: In what ways can a digital system be configured to allow charities and stakeholders to interactively commission frames of data around work and spending, to produce narratives which may stimulate a dialog?


## Thesis Structure
This is a short section outlining the thesis' narrative, and chapter content.

## Methods Outline
This is a short section designed to brief the reader at a very high level what sort of data and analysis they should expect to see in the thesis. Work Place studies, Ethnographic techniques, and orientation to analysis are *briefly* touched upon.

# Chapter 2: Literature Review
This chapter discusses the relevant literature necessary to ground the investigations of the thesis.

## Introduction

### A quick note on my perspective
I take a paragraph here to reflect on my own position regarding the matters covered as they relate to my experience within the third sector, as well as inhabiting the world of post-2010 Austerity. I thus draw the readers attention to how the theoretical matters discussed in literature may manifest on-the-ground.

## Charities, what are they good for?
This section introduces the term Charity and discusses their place in civic society in order to elaborate on the setting for the research, and unpick why this is a necessary and ethical endeavour.

### What is a charity?
This section elaborates on the various forms of non-profit, and charitable organisation that have been defined in both legal and academic literature. It later produces a working definition that should be kept in mind when reading the remaining chapters of the thesis.

### Why are Charities Important?
This section takes forward the definitions of charity discussed earlier to understand their various roles in civic society, and situates charities as performing important work that is intertwined with *Social Capital*. Social Capital is discussed as relevant to ground charity work within the fabric of civil life.

### What are the challenges of Charities today?
This section discusses in depth the challenges of Charities as experienced under austere economies and the shift towards new language and business-models designed to expose them to market forces. This is then grounded by how Social Capital is affectd, and the wider implications that this may have on society.

### Summary

## Why is Transparency Important to Charities?
This section introduces the concepts of transparency and accountability, specifically as they pertain to charities, and therefore their use to civic society's engagement with these organisations.

### What is Transparency?
The multitude of definitions of the word transparency are discussed here, and the complexity of this space is introduced.

### Transparency and Accountability
Accountability is discussed here as it relates to transparency, and how our understanding of the terms in relation to each other affect the organisational practices that are resultant. Attention is paid to Koppel's framework of Accountability and specifically the 'Multiple Accountability Disorder' that becomes central to the research.

### Accounting
Some time is spent discussing the history of accounting technology, from ledgers and practices and what their purposes are.

### Summary

## How can Digital Technologies support NPO Transparency and Accountability?
This section discusses how research and practices from HCI contribute to the potential for technology to assist with the problemspace outlines above

### Interacting with Data
Attention is paid here to Human-Data Interaction and situating Data as a Boundary Object; which may then be appropriated as a useful tool in understanding the role of technologies and data in the accountability process.

### How do digital technologies allow people to interact with finances and financial data?
More specific attention is paid to the ways in which digital technologies have already supported interactions between humans and finances. Examples are taken at both group and individual level to explore the possibilities of technologies operting in this space.

## Opportunities

## Summary



# Chapter 3: Methodology and Methods
This chapter explore the research's over-arching methodology and the individual methods that have been employed here.

## Introduction


## A Work Place study
This section situates the thesis within the tradition of a workplace study.

### Timeline
A timeline for the research

### Research Landscape: The Patchwork Project
The main setting for the research is elaborated upon here, as main research partners. Attention is paid to how I intergrated into the organisation, and how this environment affected study.

### "Matt's got his notebook out": Approaches to Fieldwork, Collaboration and Analysis
This section explains the research's specific methods for orienting to, collecting, and analysing data.

#### Fieldwork methods

#### Design methods

#### Interactions, Work, and Labour: Analytical frameworks

## Personal Reflections and Reflexivity
This section reflects on the position of myself as a researcher in the settings that the research took place in, and discusses things that affected the practice of the research ie the Hawthorne effect and issues of objectivity.

### Ethical Conundrums and Identity

### "Climb every mountain higher": Personal Highs and Lows


# Chapter 4: Accounts and Accountability - a fieldwork case study of work practice.
This chapter provides an empirical account of work practice developed through fieldwork techniques. Its focus is on how accountability requirements manifest in daily workplace practice, and what that means for technologies operating in this space.

## Introduction

## Background (Recap of relevant literature)

## Study scope and method details
Outlines the fieldwork, as well as giving some relevant details of the setting, discussing specific methods such as data collection, nature of field visits, activities engaged in, details of fieldwork diaries, interview details.

## Findings

### Money and Spending
Outlines how money is acquired, organised, and spent within the organisation. Attention is paid to money's flow around a system, as well as how that system is embodied in the actions of the workers in the charity. Contains detials of accounting, and producing accounts.

### Reporting on Activity and Outcomes
Outlines how "productive work" is performed in the organisation, as well as how this is accounted for. Social Media is discussed as a technology, as well as the use of pictures and other contextual information that is designed to produce narratives.

### Accountability In-The-Moment
Discusses aspects of producing accountability that happen on-the-fly without any formal reporting mechanism, such as how trustees can understand what's happening within the organisation at a glance.

### Hidden Work (Reproductive Labour)
Discusses aspects of the organisation's work that is otherwise hidden from view. Differs from the previous section in scope as this specifically pertains to work practices of the organisation that are required to reproduce the organisation itself, and not necessarily related to an embodied in-the-moment accountability.

## Discussion

### Matching Accountability with Accountability of Work Practice
This section discusses the notion of accountability in the context with the work practice accountability definition understood by HCI and CSCW fields

### Solve et Coagula: Supporting a Configurable Transparency
This section discusses the design requirement that a Configurable transaprency must be supported to better produce accountability for the organisation

### Proposing Linked Data to create Contexts
This section proposes linked data solutions as a means to producing the characteristics outlines above.

### Summary / Conclusions

# Chapter 7: Discussion
This chapter presents a meta-discussion around the findings of chapters 4--6 around the design, development, and deployment of systems in this space. Aspects of future systems are discussed in terms of the interactions that such systems should reasonably seek to provide in order to help enable the Transparency and Accountability of Charities, and contributes new language (Dialogic Accountabiltiy) in order to help contextualise this.

# Chapter 8: Conclusions
The final chapter concludes the thesis by providing an overview of work that has been performed, and reviews the overll findings presented in Chapter 7 in terms of the research questions that were discussed in Chapter 1. Such as further research into developing the systems
