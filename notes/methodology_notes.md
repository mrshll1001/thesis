 Introduction
 ------------

 This chapter discusses and interrogates the methodologies, approaches, and procedures used in the performance of the research project. It begins by describing the methodological frameworks that informed the project holistically via introducing the landscape in which the research was performed; and reflects on how the research was organised on-the-ground around this landscape. In doing this I reflect on how my visions of participation going into the project required a degree of reconfiguration in order to be reconciled with the realities of becoming involved in the glorious, yet often erratic world, that is the Third Sector.

 This section discusses how the research was organised around the landscape it was performed in. I present a brief overview of the organisations who participated in the research, and discuss how the characteristics each of these required the research to be configured in response.

### Research Landscape or ‘The Volcanic Soil of the Third Sector’

 As discussed in Chapter 1, the Third Sector is a sector of economic activity that is situated outside of both Government and For-Profit contexts. The organisations that make up this sector come in an inordinate amount of shapes, flavours, and structures but all share important characteristics – they do not distribute profit to shareholders, they are self-governing, and they do not coerce participation in their activities (historically, at least). They are generally seen as important actors in society; since their very existence can be argued as a symptom of a market failure for both the State and capitalist ventures to provide adequate solutions to hardships of their beneficiaries. This is often manifested as an attendance to matters such as grassroots development, and/or the provision of local services which are generally understood to produce or sustain Social Capital.

 If we take the above as granted, then the importance of the Third Sector to society at large is already fairly remarkable. During the period of time described in the research, however, the UK has been in the throes of a Conservative-lead policy of ‘Austerity’ for some time following capitalism’s latest crisis (the 2008 crash). Government cuts have resulted in the drastic reduction or death of many State-provided or Local Government services in many contexts (Health and Social Care, Youth and Play Work, Support Services, to name a few), which has in turn resulted in Third Sector organisations such as Charities ‘picking up the slack’ and providing services to communities themselves, often on behalf of the same Local Government Organisations (Councils) that once provided them in-house. This is often achieved by combining funding received from partnership with the Councils with other funding sought from elsewhere. At the same time, large amounts of funding are *"drying up"* (as one participant put it) and charities are often struggling to survive month-to-month.

 This bears mentioning because the gravity of this situation became apparent to me early on in my fieldwork, and all actions that I took (particularly producing design interventions) would have real impacts on the organisations I worked with. Given the current state of affairs, I put forward that any and all research performed on, with, within, or otherwise alongside Charities is akin to farming on volcanic soil. Charities are often the focal point for community activity, and act as a crucible in which the forces of change are reaching a critical temperature and therefore research performed on this soil is intensively fertile. The trade-off is that if one is researching without genuine care for the fruits of their (and their collaborators’) labours; if they are unaware of the pressures that they operate under — then they risk having a severe and real impact on an organisation’s ability to perform their work and in turn, sacrifice the lives of those caught in the fallout.

 The bulk of my research was performed with a small charity known as ‘The Patchwork Project’ (Patchy, to the locals) in the West End of Newcastle upon Tyne; an area known largely for suffering the regular tensions related to economic deprivation and a high immigrant population. Patchy, are a Youth Charity who cater their activities to those aged between 8-25. More can be read about them in Chapter 3, however my prolonged involvement with them, especially in the early stages of research, ensured that

 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 ### Ethnomethodological Orientation to Fieldwork

 The goal of fieldwork in this research was to provide a corpus of data that could be used to understand how those operating in the design space (workers at charitable organisations) reasoned about their work, their finances, and what role digital technologies played in this. Taking an ethnomethodolgical orientation to the fieldwork allows the investigation to focus on pragmatics of how accounting work is done in charities, how members of these settings engage with each other accountably, and thus how organisational Transparency and Accountability are, in turn, “done” @crabtree_doing_2012 [@garfinkel_studies_1967]

 Ethnomethodology concerns itself with how members of a social setting organise and make sense of their social world; carring very little commitment to particular epistemologies or ontologies excepting those that are utilised on a mundane basis by the focus of its studies @randall_fieldwork_2007 [@garfinkel_studies_1967]. Further to this, it has been said, however, that Ethnomethodology *"carries little or no theoretical baggage"* and consists of analytical choices as to what the fieldworker attends to @randall_fieldwork_2007. Its focus on how members of a setting construct their reality, however, gives it attitudes rooted in Phenomenology’s description of the *Natural Attitude* @sharrock_ethnomethodologists_1986.

 Ethnomethodology has a variety of flavours, and has given rise to such practices as Conversation Analysis **CITE SACKS HERE**. My fieldwork was focused on the everyday practices of a setting and as such I consider it an instance of an *ethnomethodological study of work*.

 Following from this, ethnomethodology focuses on how the interactional work performed by a setting’s members is made ‘accountable’ to others.

 One notable feature of Ethnomethodology is the ‘indifference’ of sociological dichotomies such as the question of objectivity vs subjectivity, and instead insists that the fieldworker develop a *vulgar competence* in a setting’s work to be able and describe it in the language of the setting’s members @randall_fieldwork_2007 [@crabtree_doing_2012]. In doing so, this acknowledges how members of the setting are producing and recognising their own contextual structures; and how they are making them mutually intelligible or naturally accountable to one another @garfinkel_studies_1967 [@randall_fieldwork_2007].

 Finally, the relationship that ethnomethodologically-informed fieldwork has to systems design contexts made it suitable for these enquiries.

 ### Taking a Marxist stance

 The performance of the first large portion of fieldwork in the study, beginning March 2016, overlapped with a series of events in my personal life that began a pronounced interest in Marxism. This is worth mentioning because the process resulted in engagment with a host of classic, modern, and academic literatures. This had a subsequent effect on my reading of fieldwork data with regards to labour relations of workers, and helped shape the design of systems that were built in response.

 Marxism, and therefore Marxist stances, can be said to be concerned primarily with the relationships between workers, their labour, capital, and property @singer_marx:_2001 [@johnson_blackwell_2012]. The foci offered by Marxism resonated with the research goals in as much as they were set out to determine in what ways the work of charities related to financial capital, and what role technology played in this relationship. Taking a Marxist stance meant, to me, orienting myself to how the labour of workers in charities was performed; how it was valued, and how it was represented in the various types of formal and informal accounts produced at the field site when accounting for activity or spending.

 In Marxist theory, the work and value of any organisation, charities included, is ultimately derived from the labour of its workers @marx_contribution_1970. Classic political economy (e.g. @smith_inquiry_1785) divides labour into the categories of *Productive Labour* and *Unproductive Labour*. *Productive Labour* is labour that directly goes into increasing the wealth of an organisation, whereas *Unproductive Labour* is that which does not; but is nontheless necessary for the organisation or nation to function @smith_inquiry_1785. Marxism is famous for its critique of this classical and arbitrary divide of the productive and unproductive forms of labour; a critique that, in summary, attacks the notions of *Productive* and *Unproductive* as having no neutral definition; as work is not naturally productive and it takes work to make it so @marx_capital_1974 [@marx_theories_1964]. Instead, what is seen as *Productive* or *Unproductive* is in constant flux and based on a multitude of different factors such as the mode of production[^1], social class, and what the ‘product’ actually is @marx_capital_1974. When studying charities, this makes sense — taking the classical approach, it would seem as if the only thing within a charity that could be called *Productive Labour* is the act of writing applications for grants!

 The Marxist stance on labour assisted in analysis of the fieldwork by providing a framework within which I could reason about the findings. Whilst ethnomethodology allowed for pragmatic insight into the interactional work of the field site itself, Marxian critiques of labour grounded these in what was needed to be captured to provide insight into design work. Namely, if the distinction between *Productive* and *Unproductive* Labour was based on an arbitrary dilineation, where was that line drawn in the field site? How did participants reason about what they classed as productive, and how was this accounted for to themselves and others? With Marxism being so closely related to my personal politics, I was initially apprehensive about taking this analytical stance. This anxiety was at least partially assuaged when I reflected upon findings of my previous study around charities and transparency. This study discussed that tensions around transparency in spending orbited around a focus on bottom line spending; leaving out the effort (labour) of volunteers and underplaying importance of the labour required of administrative tasks when discussing outcomes; therefore emphasising the importance of accounting for the nature of workers’ labour in the field site and its relevance to design @marshall_accountable:_2016.

 In establishing the relationship between field notes from Ethnomethodological studies and Marxism, it becomes necessary to elaborate on the relationship between Marxism and Ethnomethodology themselves. Chua explores Ethnomethodology from a Marxist perspective as means in which ideological reproduction may be investigated, conceiving of ideology as a symptom of social knowledge @chua_delineating_1977. Ethnomethodology is described as a focus on investigating the rational nature of a setting’s activities and thus providing an analytical tool for Marxists to investigate how ideological systems operate as ‘natural’ ways of knowing and interpreting the world @chua_delineating_1977. Freund and Abrams share this sentiment and examine Ethnomethodology’s treatment of information and social perception as linked to the practical interests of those producing them, therfore showing that social perception and information produced by existing (and therefore bourgeouis) institutions, is false @freund_ethnomethodology_1976. This gives Ethnomethodology and Marxism important shared characteristicvs, as both see social knowledge being bound to the contexts and methods that produced them, as well as indicating that both perspectives fuse theory and praxis @freund_ethnomethodology_1976. Chua elaborates that the specificity and characteristic indifference of Ethnomethodologically-informed studies means that results must be appropriated within the wider context of Marxist sociology, but that Marxists should otherwise encourage Ethnomethogological studies @chua_delineating_1977. Conversely, investigating the relevance of Marx to Ethnomethodology, Mehan and Wood associate Ethnomethodology with a synthesis of both the hermeneutic-dialectial, and the logico-empiricist traditions; that whilst the methodology of Ethnomethodology is firmly rooted in logico-empricisim, its theory has derived from hermeneutic-dialectics, and Ethnomethodology’s alienation as a method stems from this transcendancy of its conflicting roots @mehan_morality_1975. Marxism similarly straddles these realms, simultaneously having its philosophical roots in Dialectics with the development of Dialectical-Materialism, and possessing what is widely regarded as a scientific approach to the investigation of social life and political economy @thomas_marxism_2008. Also of note is the similarity between Ethnomethodology’s attendence to practical action @garfinkel_studies_1967 [@crabtree_doing_2012] and Marx’s thesis that *"All social life is essentially practical"* @marx_theses_1963. Indeed, Mehan and Wood argue that following the conception of Ethnomethodology, Marx can be viewed as a *"crypto-ethnomethodologist"* due to this @mehan_morality_1975.

 Beyond this, I feel that it is also important to consider that core tenants of Ethnomethodology appear to be directly related to Marxist stances on human labour. In Marxism, *Labour* is also described as *Life Activity*; encompassing not only participation in economic activity, but all acts that human beings undertake – from acts of recreation and love, to tilling fields and designing software @marx_economic_1844 [@mitchell_i_2013]. It is therefore possible to conceive of the *Interactional Work* attested to by Ethnomethodology @garfinkel_ethnomethodological_2005 [@crabtree_doing_2012] as an expression of *Labour* when viewed through a Marxist lense; and reflexively adds the act of organising one’s social reality to the definition of *Labour* as conceived of in this thesis.
