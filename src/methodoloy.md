##### Timeline
This research began in late February 2016 when I reached out to the Patchwork Project as potential participants. Following a brief meeting with them at the [Shawarma Fattoush](http://fattoushne4.co.uk/) restaurant in Newcastle,  I began fieldwork the following week. The research then ended in late August 2018, culminating full-circle in a meal at the same restaurant (and on the same table) as where it began. The work inbetween these two dates consisted of several "phases" of work within the context of the workplace study that addressed the material needs of the research: an initial in-depth phase of fieldwork to understand how the interactional work of transparency and accountability was organised in a charity; a phase of iterative user-centred design to produce responses to the initial findings; early and expanded deployments which involved multiple organisations and methods; and finally some additional evaluation designed to bring in perspectives of other workers within the ecosystem such as accountants and funders as well as gather field data on some final iterative improvements made to the systems.

In practice, the "phases" of research followed on naturally from each other and are not as cleanly delineated as FIGURE X implies. As the research progressed partners were added and my understanding of each facet of the research grew, the research and I needed to accommodate this growth despite perhaps having ostensibly "passed that phase of the research" previously. This was most prominent in the relationship between the "design phase" of the research and the "evaluation phase". For example sometimes the addition of raw exposure through more time spent at Patchwork during deployments meant partook in a conversation or observed something lead to a new understanding of their work practice. Or a conversation with another partner organisation (Gateshead Older People's Assembly) lent an important critique of the work so far. This is perfectly normal for evaluation, but notably lead to further iteration on tools and systems to incorporate the new knowledge. To do otherwise seemed unnatural and, frankly, unethical given the collaborative nature of the setting and the nature of each partner's work.

As such the phase of research as discussed here denotes the dominant focus of the research as it progressed; but it should be acknowledged that in any given phase the activities of a previous phase continued. Field notes were always taken with a focus on work practice and the manifestation of transparency work, and small bouts of user-centred design were performed to fix bugs or add features when needed.

**Initial Fieldwork** ran from February 2016 to late summer of the same year at Pathwork. The purpose of this dedicated block of fieldwork was to orient myself to the work practices of the fieldsite. This initially involved looking explicitly at the different ways Transparency and Accountability manifested themselves as everyday practice through: characterising the performance of work related to Youth Work and management; and creating extra work from perceived or legal obligations for more formal forms of transparency and accountability. This phase of work started with weekly field visits to Patchwork, which overtime became either more frequent or less frequent as my schedule was intertwined with that of the organisation and different fieldwork methods were employed. Often I would visit several times a week in order to work on the accounts with the workers, volunteer, and take part in a team meeting. Sometimes, such as during the summer, I may not have visited during a given week. As noted, a variety of standard fieldwork methods were employed during this phase to develop praxeological accounts through techniques such as field notes, interviews, and participating in the work of the organisation itself. As the research progressed I became integrated into the daily life of the charity (and they became integrated into my daily life as a PhD student). The nature of my field notes thus shifted from "all-encompassing" to focused on specific phenomena as it occurred, and the research became characterised more by discussions around designing technologies.

**User-Centred Design**

+ Design workshops at the end of fieldwork with patchwork to start discussing technology
+ Early development on prototypes consisting of app
+ User-Centred design involving weekly updates, captured through field notes
+ After February focus moved onto developing the other components
+ characterised by no push or drive to use tools at this phase, simply develop them
+ Additional partners came through late (May), and tools were adapted to their needs

**Early Deployments**

+ Began in the summer and was largely unshepherded.
+ Check-ins were performed during regular field visits to Patchwork.
+ Check-ins with GOPA and Edbert's House were performed less often, around bi-weekly or monthly depending on schedules
+ No major tool use during this time.
+ link to section where this is reflected on

**Expanded Deployments**

+ performed due to poor uptake and use of tools in the early deployments
+ Characterised by renewed focus on iterative developments
+ This was followed by a more structured deployment with co-operative evaluations
+ Weekly challenges
+ Edbert's House were unable to commit to this phase
+ Other actors were involved in evaluating through lightweight interviews

**Additional Evaluation**

+ Consisted of further field trials with workers at Patchwork and at GOPA
+ to encourage a dedicated use of tools throughout the working day
+ Exit interviews on the research itself
