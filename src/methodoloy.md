>This section situates the thesis within the tradition of a workplace study.

Workplace Studies are a form of research that concern themselves with how workplace activities are organised and, in particular, the roles in which technologies play in assisting workers organising mundane activities and collaborative tasks @heath_TechnologySocialInteraction_2000. Within CSCW and HCI Workplace Studies have been used to inform systems design at various stages of design research.

Overview and Timeline {#methodology-overview}
---------------------
This research began in late February 2016 when I reached out to the Patchwork Project as potential participants. Following a brief meeting with them at the [Shawarma Fattoush](http://fattoushne4.co.uk/) restaurant in Newcastle,  I began fieldwork the following week. The research then ended in late August 2018, culminating full-circle in a meal at the same restaurant (and on the same table) as where it began. The work inbetween these two dates consisted of several "phases" of work within the context of the workplace study that addressed the material needs of the research: an initial in-depth phase of fieldwork to understand how the interactional work of transparency and accountability was organised in a charity; a phase of iterative user-centred design to produce responses to the initial findings; early and expanded deployments which involved multiple organisations and methods; and finally some additional evaluation designed to bring in perspectives of other workers within the ecosystem such as accountants and funders as well as gather field data on some final iterative improvements made to the systems.

In practice, the "phases" of research followed on naturally from each other and are not as cleanly delineated as FIGURE XYZ implies. As the research progressed partners were added and my understanding of each facet of the research grew, the research and I needed to accommodate this growth despite perhaps having ostensibly "passed that phase of the research" previously. This was most prominent in the relationship between the "design phase" of the research and the "evaluation phase". For example sometimes the addition of raw exposure through more time spent at Patchwork during deployments meant partook in a conversation or observed something lead to a new understanding of their work practice. Or a conversation with another partner organisation (Gateshead Older People's Assembly) lent an important critique of the work so far. This is perfectly normal for evaluation, but notably lead to further iteration on tools and systems to incorporate the new knowledge. To do otherwise seemed unnatural and, frankly, unethical given the collaborative nature of the setting and the nature of each partner's work.

As such the phase of research as discussed here denotes the dominant focus of the research as it progressed; but it should be acknowledged that in any given phase the activities of a previous phase continued. Field notes were always taken with a focus on work practice and the manifestation of transparency work, and small bouts of user-centred design were performed to fix bugs or add features when needed.

**Initial Fieldwork** ran from February 2016 to late summer of the same year at Pathwork. The purpose of this dedicated block of fieldwork was to orient myself to the work practices of the fieldsite. This initially involved looking explicitly at the different ways Transparency and Accountability manifested themselves as everyday practice through: characterising the performance of work related to Youth Work and management; and creating extra work from perceived or legal obligations for more formal forms of transparency and accountability. This phase of work started with weekly field visits to Patchwork, which overtime became either more frequent or less frequent as my schedule was intertwined with that of the organisation and different fieldwork methods were employed. Often I would visit several times a week in order to work on the accounts with the workers, volunteer, and take part in a team meeting. Sometimes, such as during the summer, I may not have visited during a given week. As noted, a variety of standard fieldwork methods were employed during this phase to develop praxeological accounts through techniques such as field notes, interviews, and participating in the work of the organisation itself. As the research progressed I became integrated into the daily life of the charity (and they became integrated into my daily life as a PhD student). The nature of my field notes thus shifted from "all-encompassing" to focused on specific phenomena, as I relied less on them to describe broadly how the workers at Patchwork organised their social world.

**User-Centred Design** (UCD) was the main characteristic of the next phase of research as focus evolved to investigating, designing, and implementing potential interventions. Fieldwork began to shift into UCD in late August with the completion of a design workshop focused around future technologies. In September the field visits took a short pause mandated by both Patchwork's need to deliver the final part of their summer programme, and Open Lab's need to deliver CHI papers. Thankfully, this afforded me the space to reflect on the findings of the fieldwork to date which resulted in the analysis presented in Chapter 3 of this thesis. The work's rhythm resumed in October with design work consisting early prototyping and regular design crits worked into field visits and discussions and captured through field notes and requirements documents where appropriate. Design discussions maintained a vision of the larger system, but focused on different components in turn. October to December mostly focused on producing designs and implementations for a mobile application which became Accounting Scrapbook. After the winter break, development on what became Rosemary Accounts began and design was directed towards this away from Accounting Scrapbook. Throughout the whole process, discussions around the needs of the data and tools fed into the development of the Qualitative Accounting data standard, although it should be noted that Patchwork were much more interested in how the tools could produce and process information rather than standards development required for the design. This phase of research did not have a tangible drive by either myself or Patchwork to put our designs to use, simply develop them, whereas later stages of the research contained small pockets of iterative design and development while the tools were (supposedly) in use. In late April Patchwork and I were getting ready to begin phasing in use of the tools as additional partners were added to the research in the form of Edbert's House and Gateshead Older People's Assembly (GOPA). Early discussions with these partners revealed new needs which were acted upon through some further design and implementation work and extended this phase of research until the end of May to account for their needs, improve the overall quality of the tools, and encourage their participation during deployments

**Early Deployments** lasted a total of four months from the beginning of June until the end of September. The deployments themselves were mostly unshepherded, in that I did not instruct the participants to use the tools in a particular manner other than providing technical support on their use when requested. At the outset of the early deployments all participants expressed their enthusiasm at using the tools they'd seen develop, so my intention was to try and understand how these tools could be *appropriated* by workers to support their existing work as it pertained to collecting and presenting information. I did "check in" on each of the participant organisations throughout the deployment, although the nature of these was different depending on my relationship to each one. "Checking in" on Patchwork was integrated into my visits there, where I could observe the use and non-use of the tools and casually chat or interview the workers as the deployment went on. As my relationship with GOPA and Edbert's House was not as strongly developed; my regular visits had a distinctly more formal feeling. These were performed either bi-weekly or monthly depending on the schedules of myself and the workers there. Occasionally some lightweight design work was performed to fix a bug or tweak a feature to encourage or facilitate use. Despite this and for a variety of reasons this phase of the research did not see a lot of engagement from any participants regarding the deployed tools (even at Patchwork). This is analysed and reflected on in detail in the discussion in [Chapter X](#).

**Expanded Deployments** became necessary due to the poor uptake of the systems that had characterised the previous phase of the research. A year on from the original phase of design and development I renewed focus on making Accounting Scrapbook and Rosemary Accounts better integrate into the daily practices of my partners. Edbert's House unfortunately withdrew from the research as the worker who had been my primary contact left the charity and, in lieu of the limited engagement so far, the organisation felt they couldn't commit to maintaining our relationship. Patchwork and GOPA, however, agreed to commit to a more structured effort to use the technologies with a view of iteratively improving them as we continued the deployment. The deployments were characterised by being slow and requiring several different attempts to encourage engagement such as "weekly tasks" designed for participants to walk themselves through different features of the system which eventually became walkthrough sessions lead by myself. As such these structured deployments lasted a long time; from October 2017 until April 2018. It should be noted that the timescales for this phase of the research were extended due to the rise of mental health issues affecting my work during 2018 ([link to notes about this?](#)). When both Patchwork and GOPA had completed the initial set of structured tasks I sought engagement from other actors within the sector such as funders and accountants. Several individuals were happy to give me their time and they assisted the evaluation of the tools by participating in interviews during the summer.

**Additional Evaluation** was performed in the final months of the research. This was, in my eyes, designed to compensate for what I perceived as a lack of proper engagement with the tools and to discuss with participants findings that had arose during my conversations with funders and accountants. Through lessons learned from both earlier deployments, a short "challenge" was issued to participants to try and capture a "week in the life" of their organisation using the features of Accounting Scrapbook and Rosemary Accounts as much as possible. The engagement with this lead, somewhat ironically, to the discovery of several technical issues in the systems which meant that the "week" turned into several weeks as progress was halted and began again several times. Following this dedicated use of the tools and reflection thereof through dicussion, an exit interview was performed with each organisation to discuss the purpose and implementation of the research itself and the final state of our designs.

Orientations to Analysis {#methodology-analysis}
------------------------
Ethnomethodology

+ goal of the research was to understand the ways in which transparency and accountability are "done" in charitable Organisations w/ regards to the role digital technologies (may) play
+ to provide insights that may be used for design workers operating in this space
+ as part of that, fieldwork was performed early in the research and an ethnomethodological orientation was taken to the performance of fieldwork and the analysis of the data from it
+ ethnomethodology characterised by an orientation to members of a social setting organise and produce their social world in an ordered way.
+ While not epistemologically indifferent, rooted in phenomonology, it is said to carry *"little or no theoretical baggage"* and consists of analytical choices as to what the fieldworker attends to @randall_fieldwork_2007".
+ specific flavour of ethnomethodology was an *ethnomethodolgical study of work*
+ ethnomethodological studies of work have a significant history with systems design
+ benefits this approach brings to this study is the encouragement to develop a *vulgar competence* in the setting's work because of the indifference to traditional dichotomies such as subjectivity vs objectivity
+ particularly important is the nature of reflexivity in ethnomethodology, rather than the interpretive ethnographies that hand-wave reflexivity to certify their theoretical interpretations of action - reflexivity is here conceived of as a natural part of producing the setting and that members themselves possess the everyday analytical skills required to provide accounts of their work. This is essential in two ways;
+ first, by developing a vulgar competence in a setting I as a designer may develop intimate understanding of its work which can be used to develop praxeological accounts and inform design; with the goal of this research being to *actually design in this space* as well as provide long-term design requirements to inform future work
+ second, reflexivity in ethnomethodology is predicated on members of a setting engaging in interactional work that make their actions account-able to others in a setting. This is done by making actions observable and understandable for all those caring to look. That the topic of this research concerns transaprency and accountability in the grander sense of the terms makes it appropriate as the orientation to analysis mirrors the subject of my attention as a designer and a researcher. By asking "how is transparency and accountability produced in a setting", what actions make it up, and how I (through my vulgar competence) understand that to be so through the accountability of those actions; a line from transparency work to design requirements supporting the transparency and accountability of an organisation can be made. 


+ Marx
+ why appropriated
+ how that influences the nitty gritty methods
+ @randall_fieldwork_2007 analytical choices as to the attention of the fieldworker, allows ethnomethodology to do the bulk of the work understanding the production of the transparency in the setting without clashing with marxist political economy as to why such things are necessary in the first place.
