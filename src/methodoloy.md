##### Timeline
This research began in late February 2016 when I reached out to the Patchwork Project as potential participants. Following a brief meeting with them at the [Shawarma Fattoush](http://fattoushne4.co.uk/) restaurant in Newcastle,  I began fieldwork the following week. The research then ended in late August 2018, culminating full-circle in a meal at the same restaurant (and on the same table) as where it began. The work inbetween these two dates consisted of several "phases" of work within the context of the workplace study that addressed the material needs of the research: an initial in-depth phase of fieldwork to understand how the interactional work of transparency and accountability was organised in a charity; a phase of iterative user-centred design to produce responses to the initial findings; early and expanded deployments which involved multiple organisations and methods; and finally some additional evaluation designed to bring in perspectives of other workers within the ecosystem such as accountants and funders as well as gather field data on some final iterative improvements made to the systems.

In practice, the "phases" of research followed on naturally from each other and are not as cleanly delineated as FIGURE X implies. As the research progressed partners were added and my understanding of each facet of the research grew, the research and I needed to accommodate this growth despite perhaps having ostensibly "passed that phase of the research" previously. This was most prominent in the relationship between the "design phase" of the research and the "evaluation phase". For example sometimes the addition of raw exposure through more time spent at Patchwork during deployments meant partook in a conversation or observed something lead to a new understanding of their work practice. Or a conversation with another partner organisation (Gateshead Older People's Assembly) lent an important critique of the work so far. This is perfectly normal for evaluation, but notably lead to further iteration on tools and systems to incorporate the new knowledge. To do otherwise seemed unnatural and, frankly, unethical given the collaborative nature of the setting and the nature of each partner's work.

As such the phase of research as discussed here denotes the dominant focus of the research as it progressed; but it should be acknowledged that in any given phase the activities of a previous phase continued. Field notes were always taken with a focus on work practice and the manifestation of transparency work, and small bouts of user-centred design were performed to fix bugs or add features when needed.

**Initial Fieldwork** ran from February 2016 to late summer of the same year at Pathwork. The purpose of this dedicated block of fieldwork was to orient myself to the work practices of the fieldsite. This initially involved looking explicitly at the different ways Transparency and Accountability manifested themselves as everyday practice through: characterising the performance of work related to Youth Work and management; and creating extra work from perceived or legal obligations for more formal forms of transparency and accountability. This phase of work started with weekly field visits to Patchwork, which overtime became either more frequent or less frequent as my schedule was intertwined with that of the organisation and different fieldwork methods were employed. Often I would visit several times a week in order to work on the accounts with the workers, volunteer, and take part in a team meeting. Sometimes, such as during the summer, I may not have visited during a given week. As noted, a variety of standard fieldwork methods were employed during this phase to develop praxeological accounts through techniques such as field notes, interviews, and participating in the work of the organisation itself. As the research progressed I became integrated into the daily life of the charity (and they became integrated into my daily life as a PhD student). The nature of my field notes thus shifted from "all-encompassing" to focused on specific phenomena, as I relied less on them to describe broadly how the workers at Patchwork organised their social world.

**User-Centred Design** (UCD) was the main characteristic of the next phase of research as focus evolved to investigating, designing, and implementing potential interventions. Fieldwork began to shift into UCD in late August with the completion of a design workshop focused around future technologies. In September the field visits took a short pause mandated by both Patchwork's need to deliver the final part of their summer programme, and Open Lab's need to deliver CHI papers. Thankfully, this afforded me the space to reflect on the findings of the fieldwork to date which resulted in the analysis presented in Chapter 3 of this thesis. The work's rhythm resumed in October with design work consisting early prototyping and regular design crits worked into field visits and discussions and captured through field notes and requirements documents where appropriate. Design discussions maintained a vision of the larger system, but focused on different components in turn. October to December mostly focused on producing designs and implementations for a mobile application which became Accounting Scrapbook. After the winter break, development on what became Rosemary Accounts began and design was directed towards this away from Accounting Scrapbook. Throughout the whole process, discussions around the needs of the data and tools fed into the development of the Qualitative Accounting data standard, although it should be noted that Patchwork were much more interested in how the tools could produce and process information rather than standards development required for the design. This phase of research did not have a tangible drive by either myself or Patchwork to put our designs to use, simply develop them, whereas later stages of the research contained small pockets of iterative design and development while the tools were (supposedly) in use. In late April Patchwork and I were getting ready to begin phasing in use of the tools as additional partners were added to the research in the form of Edbert's House and Gateshead Older People's Assembly (GOPA). Early discussions with these partners revealed new needs which were acted upon through some further design and implementation work and extended this phase of research until the end of May to account for their needs, improve the overall quality of the tools, and encourage their participation during deployments

**Early Deployments** lasted a total of four months from the beginning of June until the end of September. The deployments themselves were mostly unshepherded, in that I did not instruct the participants to use the tools in a particular manner other than providing technical support on their use when requested. At the outset of the early deployments all participants expressed their enthusiasm at using the tools they'd seen develop, so my intention was to try and understand how these tools could be *appropriated* by workers to support their existing work as it pertained to collecting and presenting information. I did "check in" on each of the participant organisations throughout the deployment, although the nature of these was different depending on my relationship to each one. "Checking in" on Patchwork was integrated into my visits there, where I could observe the use and non-use of the tools and casually chat or interview the workers as the deployment went on. As my relationship with GOPA and Edbert's House was not as strongly developed; my regular visits had a distinctly more formal feeling. These were performed either bi-weekly or monthly depending on the schedules of myself and the workers there. Occasionally some lightweight design work was performed to fix a bug or tweak a feature to encourage or facilitate use. Despite this and for a variety of reasons this phase of the research did not see a lot of engagement from any participants regarding the deployed tools (even at Patchwork). This is analysed and reflected on in detail in the discussion in [Chapter X](#).

**Expanded Deployments**

+ performed due to poor uptake and use of tools in the early deployments
+ Characterised by renewed focus on iterative developments
+ This was followed by a more structured deployment with co-operative evaluations
+ Weekly challenges
+ Edbert's House were unable to commit to this phase
+ Other actors were involved in evaluating through lightweight interviews

**Additional Evaluation**

+ Consisted of further field trials with workers at Patchwork and at GOPA
+ to encourage a dedicated use of tools throughout the working day
+ Exit interviews on the research itself
