A Work Place study

This section situates the thesis within the tradition of a workplace study.



### A Work Place study
+ what
+ why - goals

##### Timeline
This research began in late February 2016 when I reached out to the Patchwork Project as potential participants. Following a brief meeting with them at the [Shawarma Fattoush](http://fattoushne4.co.uk/) restaurant in Newcastle,  I began fieldwork the following week. The research then ended in late August 2018, culminating full-circle in a meal at the same restaurant (and on the same table) as where it began. The work inbetween these two dates consisted of several "phases" of work within the context of the workplace study that addressed the material needs of the research: an initial in-depth phase of fieldwork to understand how the interactional work of transparency and accountability was organised in a charity; a phase of iterative user-centred design to produce responses to the initial findings; early and expanded deployments which involved multiple organisations and methods; and finally some additional evaluation designed to bring in perspectives of other workers within the ecosystem such as accountants and funders as well as gather field data on some final iterative improvements made to the systems.

In practice, the "phases" of research followed on naturally from each other and are not as cleanly delineated as FIGURE X implies. As the research progressed partners were added and my understanding of each facet of the research grew, the research and I needed to accommodate this growth despite perhaps having ostensibly "passed that phase of the research" previously. This was most prominent in the relationship between the "design phase" of the research and the "evaluation phase". For example sometimes the addition of raw exposure through more time spent at Patchwork during deployments meant partook in a conversation or observed something lead to a new understanding of their work practice. Or a conversation with another partner organisation (Gateshead Older People's Assembly) lent an important critique of the work so far. This is perfectly normal for evaluation, but notably lead to further iteration on tools and systems to incorporate the new knowledge. To do otherwise seemed unnatural and, frankly, unethical given the collaborative nature of the setting and the nature of each partner's work.

As such the phase of research as discussed here denotes the dominant focus of the research as it progressed; but it should be acknowledged that in any given phase the activities of a previous phase continued. Field notes were always taken with a focus on work practice and the manifestation of transparency work, and small bouts of user-centred design were performed to fix bugs or add features when needed.
