Chapter 6: Scaffolding Dialogues - deploying, evaluating, critiquing {#evaluation-casestudy}
=========================================================================
This chapter presents an empirical account of deploying and evaluating the novel accounting systems produced in the previous chapter, and the design requirements that arise as a result.

Introduction
-----------------
+ Previous chapters outlined the work of a charity and its implications for design, and the process of designing accounting tools and some discussion around the reflection of that design process
+ This chapter picks up where the previous one ended in terms of events in that it details the long and drawn out deployment of the systems
+ The chapter discusses how the systems were deployed: when; what manner; and who.
+ It introduces some new participants who were not charity workers in the same sense, but used to evaluate the tools from an additional perspective.
+ Findings from the research are presented grouped
+ discussions are had making points about the performance of the evaluation, as well as design implications for future systems and for open data

Study Scope
-----------------
This study and evaluation covers a staged set of deployments of the tools designed in [Chapter 5](#design-casestudy) across. During the final stages of the "User-Centred Design" phase of research two additional organisations were approached and were involved in steering a set of changes to Rosemary Accounts in particular. In June 2017 the tools were deployed with a view of evaluating their fitness for purpose as well as iterating in some small way to iron out problems and increase uptake.

As noted earlier , this took place across several phases of research as engagement and uptake of the tools was limited at first.

As the deployment and evaluation phase of the research was extended across some time and a variety of methods were used to engage participants in evaluating the systems. These methods are discussed more in-depth [earlier](#methodology-methods) in the thesis; but are touched upon here in order to situate them in the research's timeline more clearly.

### Initial Deployments

### Structured Deployments

### Interviews with Stakeholders


Findings
-----------------

### The context horseshoe (drowning in tags)

### System use and non-use

+ Duplicating use; use of social media for photos exists so the standard/systems should be adopted to harvest this as well
+ Use of excel should have been leaped on rather than designing yet another shiny thing to force them to use -- look at how existing data standards allow publishing via spreadsheets!!

### TBC (Focused around desires for other stakeholders)


Discussion
-----------------

### TBC (Focused around stakeholder buy-in)

### Dialectic Transparency

Summary / Conclusions
