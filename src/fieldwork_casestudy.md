Chapter 4: Accounts and Accountability - A Fieldwork Case Study of Work Practice. {#fieldwork-casestudy}
===================================================================================


Introduction
-------------
This chapter concerns the first phase of the research, which consisted primarily of a long period of ethnogaphic fieldwork with an orientation to work practice @crabtree_doing_2012 and the labour required to produce accountability as part of everyday work in a small charity.

This first phase of research benefitted the overall process in a number of ways. First, the ethnographic method and orientation to work practice allowed me as the researcher to develop a degree of *Vulgar Competence* in the processes and on-the-ground work that any technological intervention would need to be based around, and support. As such, the design requirements discussed at the end of this chapter are the result of analysing actual work practices of the organisation. Additionally, the length of the initial fieldwork period discussed in this chapter illustrated to me wider, much more complete, picture of the charity ecosystem; who the various actors are, and the various forms of accountable practice that a charity and its workers must employ to navigate this. Finally, I believe the initial period of fieldwork with my frequent visits and the work I performed as part of it lead to buy-in from the charity when it came to discussing, designing, and implementing technologies together at later stages of the research.

As such this chapter discusses the work practices of a small charity as they intersect with producing Transparency and Accountability. Attention is paid to different forms of work that the charity undertake and in what forms these are accounted for to others. These are then analysed to produce high-level design requirements which influenced the later design of technologies which were deployed into this space.

Participants and Setting: The Patchwork Project
----------------------------------------------------------------

This research began in earnest with my reaching out to a Youth Work charity known as *The Patchwork Project* (hereafter Patchwork or sometimes "Patchy"). I had briefly met two of the workers during my MRes project, and their contribution left a substantial impression on me. I was keen to work with them again and, thankfully, after a brief chat with them over lunch they agreed to let me engage with them through fieldwork. Patchwork's work is similar to any small charity's in that it is inherently tailored to the needs of their community, and thus are shaped by them. Any good fieldworker must treat such work as inseparable, and I therefore wish to elaborate briefly on the history of Patchwork and the community of Benwell.

The Patchwork Project began life as one of several projects originally operating under the banner of the *Benwell Young Person's Development Group*. The group formed in 2005 (NOTE: check this) as an effort to secure funding for the Benwell and Scotswood area of Newcastle, which was experiencing a withdrawal of local authority funding and feeling the effects of the resultant lack of service provision.

In 1994, *The Independent* included Benwell, Scotswood, and Elswick together in its list entitled *"No-Go Britain: Where, what, why"*. The reasons they cited were *"Crime, arson used to intimidate witnesses, feuds between rival families involved in drug dealing"* as well as citing unemployment statistics of 24%, 28%, and 26% for the three areas respectively @_NoGoBritainWhere_1994. Colloquially, the area is seen as abandoned by the city council, and owes its reputation to the conditions that arise from lack of adequate services and funding.

The rival crime families alluded to in the article are the infamous Sayers and Conroy families; often held up as Newcastle's equivalent to the Kray twins. Aside from a history of (alleged) violence, drug trafficking, and extortion Paddy Conroy rose to notoriety after escaping from a vehicle taking him to court and going on the run. Eventually being apprehended in Spain @southern_PaddyConroyReveals_2016. I recount one encounter with a member of the Conroy clan below (young person pseudonymised):

> It was one of the first Monday night sessions down at The Play Centre, also called "Patchy 2" by the staff. The session catered to ages between 8 and 12 and it was busy. One young person in particular, a young boy who looked to be around 8 or 9, was consistently acting aggressive towards the others; and there were multiple cries of "Matt! Terry punched me" or "Matt! Terry stole the football" every few minutes. Since I was still growing into my role of session worker I didn't have a lot of confidence with my authority, and I asked Dean whether I should give Terry a warning before chucking him out. Dean affirmed that this was appropriate, so I made my way over to Terry. Using my best authoritative  (and accented) voice I issued the warning.
>
> **Me:** *"Terry, this is your first warning man. Stop it or I'll chuck you out."*
>
> **Terry:** *"Nah, you won't."*
>
> He then proceeded to smirk at me before running to another group of young people across the room gathered by the pool table. When he arrived there, he paused for a second before orienting to a member of the group who was holding a pool cue. He then forcibly retrieved the cue by grappling with the person, and took their place at the pool table. In response to this I walked up to Terry, grabbed the cue back from him, and turned to orient him towards the door.
>
> **Me:** *"Get out. Come back next week. See you."*
>
> To his credit Terry calmly walked/jogged out the door. I looked around for other members of staff who had witnessed it, searching for approval. Dean raised his eyebrows and nodded slightly, which I took to mean that my response was appropriate. Unknown to me at the time, Michael had witnessed the encounter and apparently had his own take on it. Coming up behind me, he placed a hand on my shoulder:
>
> **Michael (grinning):** *"Shouldn't have done that bonny lad. That's little Terry Conroy, related to Paddy Conroy. Ye knaa of Paddy. He's just been released \[from prison\]."*
>
> I did know of Paddy Conroy.
>
> **Me (shitting myself):** *"Oh, right. What should I do?"*
>
> At this point I heard Dean burst out laughing. I briefly wondered if he was a sociopath, and then noticed Michael was also laughing as well. I looked Mike, with the dawning realisation that they might be having me on.
>
> **Mike (still laughing)**: *"Nah you'll be fine man. I mean that is Terry Conroy and he is related to Paddy. But he gets kicked out of everything all the time. Nout will happen and I doubt he'll even remember he was here in twenty minutes."*
>
> **Me: (still shitting myself):** *"Pfffft. Thanks for that Mick."*
>
> Michael then walked off smiling to himself, and the rest of the session passed uneventfully.

This vignette serves to illustrate how Patchwork have woven themselves into the fabric of the West End. Terry's respect for the workers of Patchwork was indicated by his obeyal of my command. Mike's humourous treatment of me: first threatening the possibility of violent retribution from a notorious family; then dismissing it out of hand, shows an understanding of his environment and Patchwork's position within it.

The other groups that made up *The Benwell Young Person's Development Group* eventually disbanded for a variety of reasons, but Patchwork remained, growing into its own registered charity taking over from where the previous organisational structure left off.

### People and Organisation Structure
The organisation has three full-time and four part-time staff (pseudonymised for reporting): Mike (Manager, full-time); Andi (Senior Youth Worker, full-time); Dean (Youth Worker, full-time); Lynne (Administrator, part-time replacing Chelsea who had the role when fieldwork began); Sonia (Youth Worker, part-time); and Ladislav (Youth Worker, part-time). The charity has an annual financial turnover of approximately 130k, and operates across two buildings: ‘The Project’, a community hub and central offices; and ‘The Play Centre’, a building designed for young people’s play.

+ how does the timeframe of this piece of fieldwork translate across to who is discussed

**Michael (Mike)** is the full-time Manager at Patchwork. Hailing from Sunderland he has been involved in delivering Youth Work for many years, and came to Patchwork as a manager in YEAR. As a manager and a youth worker himself Mike is involved in front-end service delivery as well as administration and management duties. He writes the majority of the funding applications, and is one of two people who work on the budgeting and accounting (alongside Chelsea/Lynne), and also is one of two people who may claim expenses alongside Andi.

**Andi** is the full-time Senior Youth Worker at the project. Moving to the North East in (YEAR), she became involved in Patchwork through XYZ. Her duties at the project involve designing front-end service delivery but also searching for funding via grant applications. She is one of two people whose money is used for purchasing and thus may claim expenses, alongside Mike.

**Dean** is a full-time Youth Worker at the project. Hailing from Benwell himself, Dean first attended Patchwork as a service user before being hired by the project as a worker. As all workers are involved in planning and delivering activities to young people, Dean performs these duties alongside Andi and Mike; but takes a special interest in XYZ. Throughout my fieldwork, Dean also took part in submitting funding applications.

**Sonia** is a part-time Youth Worker at the project. She originally interacted with the project through as a young woman and, similar to Dean, was hired to deliver services. She is the volunteer coordinator for the project, and

**Chelsea** performed administration duties when I first arrived at Patchwork, although she was never explicitly referred to as an "Administrator". Her duties included producing the budget and working on the spreadsheets alongside Michael, as well as ensuring all members of staff were paid and expenses claimed properly.

**Lynne**, as of writing, is the project's current administrator; having taken over from Chelsea around May 2016. She works two days a week at Patchwork (Monday and Tuesday), and works the rest of the week at another project in the same area (*West End Women and Girls*). When she came aboard Mike mentioned to the group in a meeting that *"It's quite exciting because the Project hasn't had a proper Administrator before"*.

**Sydney (Syd)** is Andi's dog but is often conceptualised as a worker in conversation, and is often positioned in the front of The Project and as such interacts with service users and community members often.


### Gaining Access / Integrating / Research Activities
The fieldwork reported on here was conducted over seven months with Patchwork, beginning in February 2016. This fieldwork and data collection were primarily ethnographic in nature @crabtree_doing_2012, formed of participatory-observation activities at the charity. I involved myself in a very wide variety of activities at the organisation, including shadowing workers during their day-to-day duties, assisting with accounts preparation, and performing volunteering duties on a weekly basis.

Initially, fieldwork consisted of weekly meetings timed to coincide with Chelsea's shifts (on a Thursday) so that I could assist in administration and budgeting work. After three weeks, I expanded this fieldwork to include participation in Patchwork's work as a volunteer youth worker on Monday nights, and in addition to this would involve myself during the week -- travelling to Patchwork and taking part in their activities during the day. These activities could be quite varied across the week and could consist of; planning and organising activities (including purchasing and budgeting); creating monitoring materials such as questionnaires; being involved in strategy meetings with partners; visiting the allotment and digging up food for preparation; responding to needs of service users as they wander in; visiting or hosting academics (such as Tony Jeffs) to discuss broader implications of their work; or writing funding applications.

I also partook in a lot of activities with the organisation outside of their immediate work duties; such as Fell Walking or climbing cliffs in Spain (and hosting Sid on a number of occasions while Andy was on holiday). Participation in these activities integrated me into the organisation not only by increasing my face-time with the workers, but demonstrating that I saw myself as becoming part of their community rather than an outside researcher. This in part has to do with how these activities straddle the workers' personal and professional lives; this will be discussed in full in the Findings section of this chapter.

Initially I relied on taking comprehensive field notes during visits, where possible. There were several instances where I was mocked (albeit lovingly) for having my notebook out, and others where the activity (such as digging) had to be reflected upon after the fact when I returned home. Later, when I become more confident, I began to ask workers for clarification on their tasks and purpose in the moment. I conceive of these moments as 'in-situ' interviews; and although they were not audio-recorded, they were integrated into my data through inclusion in field notes. Throughout the fieldwork I developed a 'vulgar competence' @crabtree_doing_2012 in the work of the organisation; increasing my ability to reflect and develop insight from my own experiences as well as those of other workers there.

Findings
--------
These accounts focus on how members of the setting achieve their goals through interactional work and are grouped based on the activities they relate to: Accounts of Spending; Accounts of Activities; and Accounts of Hidden Work.

### Accounting for Spending


We describe here how the charity spends money, and what is involved in producing the accounts required by legal processes. Spending occurs in two ways: core organisational costs (salaries, building rental, etc.); and spending which is based in the activities of a given working day. These each have distinct mechanisms through which money is spent, and accounted for.

#### Everyday Spending

Everyday spending is made accountable internally by funnelling spend through two senior staff members. Chelsea, the charity’s part-time administrator, described this:

**Chelsea:** *"The staff get paid back through expenses, and only Mike and Andi are allowed to make expenses claims which they’ll make generally when they notice their bank accounts are getting low"*.

Chelsea’s comment tells us two things. The first is that two senior workers, Mike and Andi, are the only ones allowed to make expenses claims for purchases. This allows them to ensure that all claims are deemed appropriate since they may monitor purchases and remove the possibility of abuse by other staff members. Their personal practices are also indicated by Chelsea – they only make claims when they *"notice their bank accounts are getting low"*. That this is possible to do also indicates the practice of storing transaction records for compilation and reimbursement. While this may initially seem restrictive, we observed practices involving the devolution of purchasing work to other staff members, allowing multiple workers to make necessary purchases. We observe that this devolution of responsibility could occur in two ways. We describe both of these in a vignette below, which details events that occurred across two days of fieldwork:

> Whilst helping prepare for a ‘Community Activity Day’, Sonia and I were tasked with producing a grocery list for the BBQ. While walking to the store we were approached on the side of the road by Mike in the minibus. He asks us if we’re *"off to buy food?"*. Sonia affirms and Mike replies *"Here, take this"* handing her his bank card, *"Do you know the PIN?"*. Sonia nods and Mike chuckles, saying *"Aye. Half of Benwell know that PIN now"* and driving off. When shopping, we explicitly choose the cheapest possible store-brand products. I ask about this and she tells me *"We can’t be seen to be buying brands really"*. We use Mike’s card to pay and later, Mike returns around an hour later and retrieves his card and the receipt of purchase from Sonia, checking over it briefly before putting it in his wallet. The next day, I was walking to the Play Centre when Mike pulled up in the minibus heading in the opposite direction at speed. He stops only to hand me 20 and tells me *"We need toilet roll for the Play Centre. Go get some from Specials' \[convenience store\] across the road, the cheap pack at the back of the shop"*. After making the purchase I head to the Play Centre which is already full of activity. I find Andi and hand her the money, which she takes and asks me for a receipt. She stores the receipt together with Mike’s cash in her back pocket.

This illustrates how spending is funnelled through the senior staff whilst still allowing the organisation to distribute the labour of purchasing by devolving responsibility. Sonia is handed Mike’s debit card so that it is *his money* that is spent, and this acts as a buffer between the member of staff and the organisation’s finances. This buffer is also present when Mike hands cash to me so that they can participate in spending. There is also both evidence of an immediate internal checking process and an awareness of wider notions of being responsible with spending. Mike checks the receipt that Sonia presents to ensure appropriateness, and Sonia does not wish to be *"seen to be buying brands"*. Sonia may have to justify purchases if called upon by Mike, and in context of the charity’s overall budget – this is due to the perceived appropriateness of a spend. This is also seen when Mike explicitly provides me with instructions to purchase the *"the big cheap pack"* of toilet roll. Overall, these internal measures show that the organisation may attest to being responsible with money when able to present context but this is unaccounted for via formal means.

#### Staff Salaries

In meetings with Chelsea during fieldwork, I discussed with her how staff are salaried at :

**Chelsea:** *"Dean and Andi get paid full time, I get paid part-time. Mike works full-time but he’s only paid part-time."*

Chelsea lists several of the staff and their pay-schemes, but noticeably says here that Mike is working full time but only paid for part of his work, indicating that his salary is variable even though his role is central to the organisation. During a subsequent fieldwork session, Mike elaborated on this:

*"It’s what’s best for …I don’t care how much I get paid, and it’s money that I have to end up looking for. I put salaries down for the last few years, and it took a while to put Dean up to 20k when he started because of money. With the \[Large Grant\] coming in now we can start thinking about putting the salaries back to normal."*

Mike’s discussion of the staff accepting lower pay provides insight into the values of the organisation. The staff are dedicated to the organisation’s work, and are aware of their impact on its finances; accepting lower pay in order to *"keep things going"*. Where Mike discusses having to look for the money to pay staff, he also touches upon how raising pay creates an increase in labour as he is required to expend effort sourcing funds to make up the difference. Further into fieldwork, Mike provides additional insight into this during discussion about staff salaries and standard pay increases amid the adjustment:

**Mike:** *"We’re putting salaries up which is a big relief for everyone. I’ll be on 30k, but not really because that means more tax so you have to judge it carefully. Because of the tax brackets, past a certain point it makes no sense to give me a pay increase because of how much it’ll cost. An extra hundred to me per week will be several thousand a year to the charity which I have to find and justify finding. This way everyone still sees their pay increase, including me, but I’m not too worried about finding the extra cash. It’s still the least you’ll ever see another project manager get paid round here though. Some larger organisations have six or seven heads on about 100k; nearly a million you need before you even get anything done."*

This emphasises Mike’s awareness of how staff salaries impact the organisation; he is willing to keep his salary lower than that of comparable positions in the area (*"round here"*) and demonstrates that he would need to justify to others a pay increase that required searching for a disproportionate amount of further funding. Mike also mentions how the staff will be relieved that the salaries are being brought in line with standard pay rises; illustrating that the salary cuts have tangible effects on staff and further defining their position as a value-driven cohort. When Mike discusses the salaries of larger organisations he also reveals his views on what money and people are supposed to do in an organisation; they are supposed to be put towards the organisation’s work and paying head staff large salaries creates pressure from extra work and financial requirements *"before you even get anything done"*.

#### Compiling Accounts

![Verifying Accounts](./src/figs/fieldwork_verifying_accounts.svg)


All income and spending must be accounted for formally through compilation of ‘the accounts’; records of financial transactions that must be produced, audited and presented to bodies such as the charity’s Board of Trustees (like a corporate executive board who act in a supervisory capacity for a charity) or the Charity Commission (UK governing body). Compiling accounts was an activity I was involved in during fieldwork, generally performed alongside the administrator (Chelsea, and later Lynne). When initially instructed in the task by Mike, I were given insight into the role of financial accounts in the organisation and what is involved in the task:

**Mike:** *"We have this budgeting tool. It’s an Excel spreadsheet really \[...\] this lad who used to work for us set it up, we can add funders and add spending and stuff and we can use it to see how much we have left in each budget. At the end of each financial year this gets sent to the accountant so they can sign it off for us."*

This encapsulates two things about how this work is performed. First, we see that it may be performed by several people, and that this role may be more transitory than others in the organisation. During the course of our involvement, the role of Administrator changes from Chelsea to Lynne, and was previously occupied by another prior to research beginning (the *"lad"*). This brings into question how well imposed administration tasks fit with the value driven nature of the organisation’s other activities. It also reveals how the organisation views using the spreadsheet when doing budgeting; Mike refers to it as a tool, with which he can present an account of the budget to himself, and can be used to generate another account to others (one which is legally or contractually stipulated).

A major component of producing a canonical set of records to produce this account to others is the act of *Reconciling* expenditure. Reconciling is the process of mapping transactions in the bank statements to transactions in the budgeting spreadsheet. The process is required as a component of having the financial accounts 'signed off' by an independent accountant. I outline the process of reconciling accounts below with an extract from my fieldwork diary:

> Lynne taught me how to reconcile accounts today. She first took a large wallet labelled receipts from behind her and inside there were two separate folders for Mike and Andi; being the only two workers who may claim for expenses. She also fetched a small box of printed bank statements. She handed me the wallet and we started going through them one by one starting with Mike's. As I read the value and items from each, Lynne would note them in the spreadsheet along with the worker and adding a budget code. Occasionally when she knew which project an expense was for she would "cost" this to a fund in a dropdown menu in a column in the spreadsheet. She would then search through her stack of printed bank statement and find the transaction that matched the expenses claim for the worker. Where an expenses claim was comprised of several receipts, she would group these together in the spreadsheet and adjust the value column for the total, rather than the individual expenses. She would then physically tick the transaction in the statement, tick the receipt that I handed to her, and list an "r" in the spreadsheet which stood for "reconciled"

I note from this extract that three components are required for reconciliation: an entry in the logbook (ie the spreadsheet); the transaction in the bank statement; and the receipt of purchase. The first point of note is that the actual reconciliation work is performed by the charity workers themselves, and that the role of the accountant is to act as a checker. It is interesting to note that while the "accounts" are the result of the workers' labour; the means of producing *accountability* using these records is not under worker control but is mediated by a paid third party. Patchwork may not present these accounts to the public and get them "signed off" by them but are required to contract out.

It is also of note that Lynne (and previously Chelsea) developed their own internal processes to producing a record that maps onto an external standard. The standard in question is that of having a canonical record of their income and spending; whereas the process of adding ticks and the reconciliation marks (the 'r' in the spreadsheet) are their own way of expressing this critical matching stage of producing a canonical set of accounts.

I did, however, witness that there is an inherent tension when presenting accounts for auditing to a chosen third party. The final stage of making your accounts canonical is the auditing processes.These require accounts to be ‘ratified’ (checked and signed) by an accountant, and often experience conflict when engaging with commercial accountants. We describe this below:

*During a meeting, Mike asks to speak to me about the accounts. "I’m not happy with the accountants at the moment, they’re being problematic". I ask why and he responds "They just want us to use Sage do you know Sage? The accountants don’t like that we don’t use Sage, and I think that’s because they can just import it and have it do their job for them." At a later meeting with trustees Mike speaks again on the issue, "We’re thinking of scrapping Ellison's. They’ve upped the price to £1300 …, and they’re trying to force us to use Sage so we do their job for them. We’ve spoken to a woman we found on the Chronicle who says she’ll do it for £20 an hour and she’s happy to do them in whatever format we want. She’s been in and looked already and she’s told us that we’ve already done the job, and all she’ll need to do is double-check a few things and sign it off. We have to make sure she’s got the right, y’know, qualifications, to do that but aye it looks much better."*.

Here Mike shows that there is an explicit point of contention that arises when commercial accounting models are misapplied to charities. The accountants use expensive commercial software and apply it as a de facto standard, presenting a barrier to the charity engaging with the auditing processes required of them. These attempts to influence Patchwork’s toolkit and thus their accounting practices demonstrates a conflict that, in order to become transparent in a particular way, they must use methods imposed upon them that do not support their own practices of accounting for money and alienating them from their current accounting processes which match their work practice. That [Sage Accounts](https://www.sage.com/en-gb/) is expensive commercial software is also of note. Patchwork own their spreadsheet; it is tool that they developed and use to produce their records. They do not own Sage, and in addition to the money it would further remove them from the ability to produce their own records in a form that becomes canonical and leads to the production of their accountability to others.

+ **This bit is about "Costing Work" we should put it somewhere where it feels at home**
 Other features of the tool and accounting process are brought to light when Mike details the process of ‘Costing’ to me:

**Mike:** *"This lets us see how much money we have in each fund, and then in the other screen here I can assign it to a funding pot and then this updates."*

At a later point in fieldwork, Mike elaborates on this practice, and how the organisation benefits from it:

**Mike:** *"I do this when someone tells me that a report \[to a funder\] is due. I’ll see what the fund says I can spend it on, and then I’ll cost things to it and move things around so that each fund is happy. Sometimes I do it when we need to spend money from a fund that’s due and I can go back and move things so it’s used up, then there’s loads to put in the report. Or sometimes if we need money for something, I’ll go and free something up from a fund by moving things to other funds."*

Costing work is as such related to the reports that funders stipulate as part of their funding arrangement with the charity. Mike shows that the organisation has some flexibility in the way that it costs things, and uses this to justify spending that may have been outside of the original proposed use for the funding.


### Accounting for Activity


As well as having to account for financial spending, are also required to account for their work activity. Accountability here is notably experienced through both formal procedures and more interpersonal interactions with the community. We outline below how the organisation navigates this, in order to explicate the work practices that support communicating the organisation’s activities to others.

#### Curating qualitative records

We observed the workers engaging in the production and curation of qualitative records that assisted them in presenting an account of their work. Some forms of record were stipulated as legal requirements, whereas others were produced at the prerogative of workers:

*During a session, I observed Andi taking photographs using her phone. She would often approach participants to take a photograph of them. Whenever possible, Andi would call to another youth worker and ask them to get into the photograph as well. The next morning, I have been tagged in photographs by ’s Facebook account alongside the other workers and young people in the photographs.*

Andi’s behaviour shows her producing a qualitative record of the event and activity that occurred. She can be seen collecting photographic evidence of their attendance in-situ, and using this to elaborate on the context of their work. The practice of uploading these to a social media profile produces an account of their activity for others, and tagging people in photographs on the platform encourages those tagged to look at them and potentially allows others (such as parents) to glimpse the activity as well. As well as on social media, print out a selection of photographs in a poster format, which are displayed around their main community hub. The workers reflected on this practice in a group discussion:

**Andi:** *"Part of it’s capturing that moment in time because it’s gonna be gone. Y’know, and it would be very easy for them to forget \[...\] So you’re capturing it for them, you’re capturing it for their parents to see what they’ve achieved, or for the \[Young People’s Award\] so they can prove whatever it is they’ve done. You’re putting on the wall as a celebration, you’re putting it in the annual report for funders to see and also for young’uns to see \[...\] Like loads of kids will be like ‘will this be going on the wall?’."*

**Mike:** *"We just take lots of pictures because it becomes a resource for us as well. The ones on the wall are of the *Young People’s Award* because they’re positive images. Sitting down two people and talking one to one and that — it’s not very entertaining."*

We see here how the organisation use a resource bank of records built up by photographs for different types of accounts, to different people. This illustrates the elasticity a record may possess; Andi relates how photographs may be used as evidence for participant’s involvement in an award, whereas Mike conceptualises them as *"positive images"* and a resource for the organisation’s future needs. Andi also explicates how the photographs are shown to parents in order to provide an account of their child’s activity with . We also see how the photographs are repurposed to provide an account of value in the annual report, and to provide a personal record for the young people when it’s placed on the wall in *"celebration"*. The ability for these records to form a resource from which different accounts can be derived also sits in contrast to other forms of work that perform that, as Mike indicates here, are more difficult to account for (*"Sitting down two people and talking one to one and that — it’s not very entertaining"*). We observed this first-hand during fieldwork when Mike expressed frustration at the records that are required to keep of their meetings with service users, and how it is difficult to present these to others:

*I followed Mike to a filing cabinet that was unlabelled. He took out a folder to show me an example, "Here. This is a monitoring form we have to fill out every time we have a chat with someone. You say who it was, what you chatted about and what the outcomes were. Standard ticky-box stuff. We’re meant to keep this, and we do by the way, but nobody ever asks to see it. I’ve got files here from ten year ago which haven’t seen the light of day. People complain at us that we’re not doing our job and ticking boxes but we are, but nobody ever comes in. Nobody ever asks."*

Mike’s frustration indicates that while he is fulfilling legal and stipulated obligations designed to make accountable for their work, they are not given the opportunity to demonstrate this properly. When Mike describes how photographs of these chats would be *"not very entertaining"* we also see that whilst could theoretically generate records of these, the effort required to do so would not result in a substantial gain for the charity when trying to demonstrate their value.

#### Accountability of activity in the community

In contrast to the perceived indifference of regulatory bodies, we found that the workers at saw themselves as being highly visible and thus accountable to their local community both in their roles as youth workers, but also as individuals within it due to an inherent visibility of their presence. This is characterised by Dean’s conception of accountability during a group discussion:

**Dean:** *"There’s the visibility in and out of work. It’s not a one-way thing, I’m not Dean the youth worker during the day and I’m not Darts-Dean at night I’m both and I’ve got to be very aware that young people and the families that I work with, \[...\], I live in the same area as them and they are watching me constantly. In and out. I’ve got to be visible. It’s... an awareness of your role within the community. And I think another one for me, being accountable is remaining humble and just thinking that I’m very much where I’ve come from and I’m very like the young people I work with and they know my family."*

With this, Dean shows us how he sees his role in the community by living and working in the same area. Dean provides a view that accountability for his actions as a youth worker is lived in each moment. He is constantly watched by those around him, even when outside of work during his recreation activities and can therefore be seen as a whole, rather than only through a lens of his output at . I saw this value in practice through the way that configures their Social Media presence:

**Andi:** *"We didn’t like having a Facebook ’Page’ because it treats you like a business and wants you to pay so everyone sees your posts. We want to be seen in the community. So we made the account a person instead and everyone is our friend and the kids message us at stupid hours …When Facebook changed it so that you couldn’t have a company name as a person, we changed our name to ‘Mike ’ as Mike doesn’t use Facebook himself. \[The community\] know it’s all of us though, not just him."*

Andi emphasises the value-driven nature of the organisation’s work through how they’ve chosen to configure their Social Media presence. She notes that whilst there is a pragmatic benefit in how personal accounts are seen on the Facebook platform, this embodies their desire to be seen as part of the community. Later, the organisation takes steps to maintain this dynamic by capitalising the identity of a worker, Mike, for use as a profile name. When Andi elaborates on her belief that the community understands they are interacting with all workers through the Facebook account, she belies her belief in the dynamic that the workers are visible and present as part of the community and are not abstracted by their involvement in the organisation – being visible and accountable.

**Note: This section involves discussing how the exta-curricular activities of Patchwork demonstrate and facilitate their involvement in the community**
In some capacity they almost always involved an element of staff training or engaging with wider members of the community. An example of this would be the activity of Fell Walking. Patchwork will often go out as a team to walk up the Fells, putting to use and further developing their skills in the activity directly, but in doing so effectively "scouting" the location as a potential activity to include young people in. That community members such as trustees or Benwell residents are often present also demonstrates Patchwork's commitment to the area, and further facilitates their ties to their service users. (**Note: that started to look a little data-y, maybe move part of that section to the findings?**).

### Accounting for Hidden Work

*Hidden Work* here refers to the effort required by the workers to make their work productive, and has been termed *Unproductive Labour* in Political Economy @marx_contribution_1970, and *Articulation Work* in CSCW texts @schmidt_taking_1992. We concern ourselves not only with how this is performed but how it is accounted for and communicated to others. In this context it refers to effort expended by workers at the charity in addition to what the task demands in-the-moment. An example would be the planning required to execute community sessions ahead of time. We found that accounting for this hidden work occurs only in conjunction with its performance, during meetings, or discussions about activities and planning – it is rare for those outside of the organisation and immediate community to be made aware of this work. Accounting for hidden work is thus more informal, and often complicated by the nature of ’s activity. We elaborate on these points below.

#### Responding Work

A lot of hidden work arises from ’s open-door policy, which requires an immediate response to community members coming through the door for their services or informal discussions – disrupting the processes by which workers are performing (and accounting for) hidden work. This came to the fore in one discussion during fieldwork:

*We were discussing another youth project operating in the city, as have recently acquired a Play Centre and are finding ways to use it most effectively so have visited other charities to learn from them. It’s mentioned that the other project execute elaborately planned evenings of activities for their attendees and Dean exclaims "They’ve got the time they don’t start until half four! As soon as that shutter goes up we have work to do!" He gestures at street-facing window towards the front of the room. The group nod in agreement*

Dean is discussing how ’s activity cannot be judged against that of another organisation with different working patterns. He also makes reference to the open door policy and its effect on their working day regarding planning and makes clear that these informal meetings are conceived of as ‘work’; there is effort expended when conversing that prevents them from performing other tasks. These conversations must be engaged in because they also form an important part of how organise their work. This was elaborated on during a group discussion with me:

**Andi:** *"So aye, \[anon\] is a good example. \[...\] I know he was doing football, I knew he was doing work experience so he’d have the time and you just think well it would be really good for him to do it for his future. Y’know, so having a conversation with him to say look are you interested in this?"*

Engaging in conversations that arise from the open-door policy can thus translate to outcomes, in this case a beneficiary getting a work experience placement based around a hobby. This qualifies Dean’s earlier utterance that the organisation has *"work to do"* as soon as they start: these conversations are work that must occur for to achieve its goals effectively, but it is difficult to provide an account of this to others.

#### Understanding Hidden Work through Context

We note that hidden work is rarely accounted for outside of the organisation and immediate community. During fieldwork, however, Mike related how outsiders may be introduced to the context of the organisation to understand the *labour* required to perform everyday tasks and achieve outcomes:

*"It’s like when this guy from \[a funder\] came in to check. Most funders don’t and they don’t understand us. He came in and he loved it. He said that he was amazed we could keep the place running, we had so much going on around here that we deal with on a daily basis."*

From this we also see that Mike understands the difficulty of accounting for this labour to others — most funders do not visit and thus do not understand how the project functions. That the funder is amazed at the scale of everyday work and effort being expended shows that this is not captured or represented elsewhere; and can be accounted for only by being present and producing one’s own account *from the context of the activity*. We later saw that this problem is compounded; and we illustrate this with a vignette of activity leading up to a scheduled evening event in the organisation:

*I was due to attend a session with a group referred to as the ‘Slovak Lasses’ group, comprised of young Slovak women aged between 15 and 24. The sessions run from 1600 approx until about 1830, and the plan is to run a BBQ event for the attendees. From 1545, two participants had turned up alongside a part-time worker and sat at computers visit Facebook. Dean is also on Facebook using the account and has several chat windows open. When prompted, Dean responded that he is "chasing up" the rest of the group to make sure that they were coming. Whilst passing, Andi convinces the attendees to accept her taking a photograph of them. Dean signs off the computer at 1630 and at 1655, there is no sign of other attendees. Dean is visibly concerned, pacing back and forward. He mutters that "we should sack this group". Sonia nods then says "this is ridiculous. We have two young people and four staff". I am dismissed by Dean who says "You can go if you want. It’s a bit weird if we outnumber the girls and we have loads of staff in".*

This example shows two things. First, it reinforces the issue of hidden hork only being able to be accounted for in-the-moment. Dean performs the additional task of ‘chasing up’ participants; work which emerges as the evening progresses and is only visible to those in the room. Secondly, it raises the issue of how the ’s efforts would appear if mapped to outcomes in an accounting process. Sonia indicates that such a mapping would not appear favourable (*"We have two young people and four staff"*), and Dean hints that this is not an uncommon occurrence (*"we should sack this group"*). has to balance the goal of maintaining a relationship with the beneficiaries – which can lead to important outcomes – with the need to make and be seen making effective use of their time and labour resources. The slower and seemingly less productive execution of the event also directly contrasts with what Mike describes as the funder’s surprise at the high levels of activity during a visit. This likely results from an intersection of elements such as the specific beneficiaries, the time of day, etc. but when isolated from context these two incidents each paint seemingly irreconcilable views of the organisation’s daily life.

#### Inferring Hidden Work

We did see that hidden work may sometimes be inferred by other members of the organisation, in addition to those present as it occurs. This is often achieved through the records that are produced as a by-product of activity in conjunction with the worker’s implicit knowledge of each others’ work practices:

*I was participating in a planning session for the evening’s activities; initiated when Dean and Andi each took out large workbooks. Andi asks "Where’s Mike?", to which Dean responds that he is "down the allotment". Andi looks puzzled at this and Dean elaborates, "He’s seeing how \[the gardener\]’s getting on" and turns the notebook to show Andi. There is a task list which shows ‘allotment’. Andi looks at this, and nods.*

This shows that workers may use records to infer the activity and thus the work of others in the charity. Dean shows Andi a workbook entry which contains only a single word that allows both Dean and Andi to construct a context around Mike’s current whereabouts. We see how Andi and Dean understand that work is being performed at the allotment, and that Mike’s absence indicates that it is him performing it. We also see how the workers are able to infer the nature of this work, as Dean is able to ascertain that Mike is checking up on someone whilst there. Similarly, we saw that financial records such as receipts could be re-appropriated and used for this inferral:

*Mike was having lunch and moving items on the table out of his way, to place his laptop there and write a report. Moving a pile of paper, he turns to inspect it and finds a receipt, saying aloud "What’s this? Ohh. It’s the pancake stuff for tonight; Sonia’s been shopping."*

The receipt makes Sonia’s work accountable internally, as Mike recognises that the items are a list of ingredients to make pancakes, an activity commonly run by the charity. He infers that there has been effort expended in acquiring these materials when he says *"Sonia’s been shopping"*, and can attribute this to Sonia through knowledge that shopping was a task to be completed and that Sonia was assigned to it. The receipt also pertains to the charity’s activity – running a session involving cooking. This shows how accounting for this hidden work hints at the organisation’s work towards goals. Notably, this we see how a record may exist within several contexts: evidencing expenditure, the inferral of activity, and the by-product of work related to activity (a cooking session) that may be accounted for.

**OI, FUTURE MARSHALL: Re-Read *Bentley and Dourish Medium vs Mechanism 1995* where they suggest a CSCW system should be adaptable through high-level customisation to meet the needs of its users. Maybe if it's not adaptable maybe then a fundamental understanding of the work means that it can be appropriated as a means of producing accounts? Eh?**

**ALso this**
+ Suchman notes that the goal-oriented and plan based models of human conduct have shortcomings; this is mirrored in the research space where we consider that spending and performed pertaining to grants may not conform to the original constraints of the funding application but is still contributing towards the wider goals, subject to complex nuances

Our findings demonstrate that those working in a charity may experience accountability in multiple ways, with reference to their values, work, and responsibilities both as an organisation and individuals. Our ethnography shows we see how legal and financial frameworks surrounding the organisation has a pronounced effect in the work required for a charity to account for the use of resources – both financial and labour – and also that members of the setting can experience this accountability as part of their everyday work in the organisation. We also saw evidence that the organisation and its workers view themselves as inseparable from their local community, thus accountable to it; this relationship requires a maintenance effort similar to the legal demands of government and funders.

Our findings show how conflicts may emerge from the ways in which the charity views itself as accountable to various stakeholders such as its community, its funders, and governmental bodies. In one key instance, we see how must be accountable to funders by reporting their use of grant money whilst simultaneously tailoring activities and spending with regard to the emergent needs of their beneficiaries. This conflict is rooted in the accountability pathways that they must engage in: charities are controlled by their funders to ensure that their spending falls within a specific remit, and this conflicts with a need to be responsive as an organisation and act in accordance with the needs of beneficiaries. This is discussed by Koppel as *Multiple Accountability Disorder (MAD)* @koppell_pathologies_2005 and compounding this is the various ways in which the organisation is required to make itself transparent. As discussed, transparency is often seen as a foundational element of accountability but the relationship between the two is nuanced – where various forms of being transparent may generate different forms of accountability @koppell_pathologies_2005 [@fox_uncertain_2007; @hood_accountability_2010].

This raises questions around the role of technologies in charities and how they allow workers to navigate conflicts inherent in their accountability requirements. In the following sections we discuss design considerations for future systems that seek to assist charities in managing the tensions associated with becoming transparent and accountable.

### Support the Accountability of Work Practice

Our research began by examining accountability from the perspective of public and voluntary sector administration, where organisations may be accountable to others through a number of different pathways such as producing answers when questioned @fox_uncertain_2007 [@koppell_pathologies_2005]. This is demonstrated in our findings as much of the work involved in ‘doing accountability’ involves workers producing answers for stakeholders in the form of reports on spending and how activities were delivered in relation to this expenditure. We posit this offers HCI an opportunity to affect change through a form of accountability with which it is intimately familiar: the accountable nature of work @garfinkel_studies_1967.

While ‘work’ in Garfinkel’s terms refers explicitly to interactional work in the accomplishment of ordering social settings, these interactions are what form the basis of an organisation’s accomplishment of its goals. For example, our findings show that a receipt of purchase obviously means someone has been shopping, and is also incorporated as evidence in the financial accounting process. We show that an organisation can account for the work that it does towards its goals but that the emergent nature of outcomes means that this only provides a partial view. We see that visitors to comment upon activity there as the work and the context of that work is made obvious; yet the accountable nature of that interaction is not supported through systematic processes for reporting.

Making accountability accountable here, then, *involves producing systems that allow the communication of organisation’s accomplishment of their work practice in relation to their goals*. This should be in such a way that the work of an organisation is made obvious at a glance. Our findings demonstrate that the charity appropriates social media as an ‘organisational accounting device’ @dourish_process_2001, making their activities observable and reportable to those who care to look. As such, we propose that technologies be developed to support the communication of work practices in context with organisational goals. For instance, accounting software that appropriates social media features such as timelines, tagging, and events to contextualise financial records or work toward outcomes. This would provide a resource for both workers and stakeholders and in doing so may begin to address the current chasm between reporting processes and the emergent nature of outcomes; making it clearer to all parties how the work of a charity sits in its local context.

It is imperative to ensure that these systems cannot be used to control or monitor the actions of workers, effectively ‘managing’ productive labour to make this accountable to funders @harper_looking_1992. Systems should instead provide workers with means to produce accounts of their work flexibly, and express these accounts in a diverse manner. This enables the different forms of transparency that predicate various accountabilities @koppell_pathologies_2005 [@fox_uncertain_2007; @hood_accountability_2010]. Such systems will thus need to enable the configuration of transparency to support making work accountable for those who care to look. We discuss how this may be achieved below.

### Enable configuration of Transparency

Charities such as are shown to engage simultaneously in multiple forms of transparency to satisfy their accountability requirements. While regulatory bodies and funders are concerned with spending money and monitoring output this is widely accepted to be divorced from the true impact of an organisation’s work @heald_varieties_2006. Simultaneously, take efforts to make themselves transparent and accountable to their community through practices such as using social media and having open-door policies.

These efforts are in line with calls to partake in more active forms of transparency which are seen as more communicative @oliver_what_2004 [@schauer_transparency_2011]. We see here, however, that this often requires extra work on behalf of the workers to articulate their results and efforts to the community on top of compiling reports for other government entities and funders. Important here is the narrative form this transparency takes, and HCI has previously seen how charities can construct narratives surrounding their work through the use of Open Data @erete_storytelling_2016. engage in a process which involves them collecting data which they fashion into narratives. Digital tools also play a role in ‘Costing Work’ to satisfy requirements that spending appears to have been in accordance with funding conditions, but is actually spent as the charity responds more directly to beneficiaries. This is an example of how charities may feel compelled to frame their work by tailoring reports to meet expectations @lowe_playing_2015, and demonstrates how the values embedded in the design have negative impacts on how the organisation may achieve its goals @pine_institutional_2014.

While previous HCI work calls for qualitative forms of accounting @marshall_AccountableExploringInadequacies_2016, we put forward that new systems must do more than simply incorporate additional metadata into the accounting process; *they must be designed with embedded values that better reflect the needs of an organisation and its beneficiaries*. As these may differ between organisations, systems should seek to support workers in easily matching their records to the required format per request without much additional labour. *Providing interfaces to retrieve, combine, and present data in a multitude of ways would go some way in supporting charities experiencing multiple accountability requirements*. Doing so acknowledges not only the conflict of multiple accountabilities and transparencies; but the problem that is the effort required to manage these conflicts separately. This would allow organisations a material means to configure transparency based on context. It also presents new opportunities for stakeholders to engage charities; if systems allowed the controlled retrieval of information @mcauley_dataware_2011, then stakeholders may actually assist in configuration work and create new ways to interpret the data that is more meaningful for them.

This may be achieved practically through providing lightweight, interoperable, data collection tools and interfaces (e.g. mobile and web applications) that allow workers to easily collect, combine, and process information based on evolving needs but *operate independently without commitment to one platform*. Thus the design embodies values of organisational control and flexibility to support workers collaborating in curating an organisational account. This account would then take the form of an interrogable dataset that can be configured to meet the mode of transparency and accountability required for a given purpose. Providing this configurable form of transparency requires that systems consider the means by which the dataset is created, curated, and queried. We address this below.

### Create Contexts through Linked Accounting

We have seen the challenges of accounting for Hidden Work; the activity behind what is being accounted for. This challenge also manifests in terms of the increasing demand for charities to not just account for their activity, but for their outcomes - the effect of their activity on the lives of those with whom they work @lowe_playing_2015. Holding organisations accountable for delivering outcomes (e.g. improving the health of a community) has been critiqued as they are often the result of overwhelmingly complex systems, which any given organisation cannot control, and therefore cannot be held accountable for @lowe_new_2013. Our findings demonstrate that a disconnect exists in how organisations may perform work and how it is reported upon; such as being concerned about numbers attending a group.

Historically, the ‘Linking Processes’ between input of work and money to work output and eventual outcomes has been problematic and poorly understood @heald_varieties_2006. People often seek to create ‘program logic models’ which connect activity to outcomes as a linear model of cause-and-effect @schalock_measuring_2003 but as discussed; outcomes are generally emergent and such models are not representative of how they come about.

Since outcomes emerge from complex systems interacting @lowe_new_2013 [@lowe_playing_2015], we have proposed that digital technologies support configuration of transparency. The role of Linked Data @bizer_emerging_2009 is central in this for two reasons. First, data is a boundary object @crabtree_human_2015 [@star_institutional_1989] that may be appropriated and adapted as a means of providing ‘alternative lenses’ on work and spending @elsden_designing_2017; as such, Linked Data supports the configuration of transparency by providing the material means to combine and show information in context based on need. This allows organisations to rapidly produce lenses on their work to satisfy reporting requirements while predicating only that an initial link be developed between income, work, and outcome to support traversal and presentation of the data. Second, Linked Data implies interoperability with other datasets which speaks to the complex nature of outcomes discussed above. These linking processes could support charities, or other actors, linking multiple datasets to better understand the complex nature of how outcomes are emergent; and from this produce a context that better situates the role of the charity in producing that outcome.

Such a system also has grounds in the legal procedures necessary to audit a charity’s financial accounts. We note that these are somewhat federated in nature; there exists a standard and agreed upon mechanism for having one’s accounts verified and signed, yet multiple actors may perform the ratification. This ecosystem resembles that postulated by the Dataware Manifesto @mcauley_dataware_2011, and creating a Linked Data set within a charity would support this process through the controlled sharing of data. This federation may be achieved through making digital tools independent and interoperable, as described above. Furthermore, linking data could see this form of federated system used to produce other forms of transparency; processes acting on Linked Data could be used to create new interfaces around work and spending that support the more active forms of transparency discussed at the start of this paper @schauer_mixed_2014.

In doing this, systems would support the creation of ‘Linked Accounting’. That is to say these systems may engender accounting and reporting process built upon the premise that organisations are being asked to account for outcomes that have no control over, but *their work (and spending) is accountable and may be linked to outcomes as having taken place*. This shifts the focus of ‘accounting’ in charities towards the accountable performance of work, and contributes Linked Data for the wider community to use in mapping and understanding the complex systems contributing to outcomes.

Conclusion
-----------

In this paper we set out to explore how an understanding of the everyday work practices of charities could be used to inform the design of systems that seek to support them in becoming transparent and accountable. We explicate that the complex nature of transparency and accountability manifests as a variety of interconnected work practices that are experienced by the charity workers, and how socio-technical systems that are used by organisations also affect these same practices. We then present implications for the design of future systems that embed values of worker control and flexibility in order to support charities navigating their obligations in everyday practice. We discuss this by drawing upon our understanding of the accountable nature of work practices, and how this may be captured and represented through interoperable digital systems that allow charities to configure transparency and accountability in accordance with their needs; leading to the concept of ‘Linked Accounting’.

Charity organisations and the HCI community share important civic and social concerns, and the reduction of barriers to a charity’s efforts through digital technologies has far-reaching implications for society. Future work should seek to further engage with charities to collaboratively develop and deploy these systems to discover how they may be appropriated into work practice to achieve organisational goals. Care should be taken to ensure that these novel accounting technologies are developed so that they are not used to control the actions of workers, but used to provide the workers a flexible means to deliver work, and to have this interpreted in a diverse number of ways. In doing so HCI may affect civic change through engagement with this rich design space.
