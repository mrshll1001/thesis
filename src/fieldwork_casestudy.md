Chapter 4: Accounts and Accountability - a fieldwork case study of work practice.
===================================================================================

This chapter provides an empirical account of work practice developed through fieldwork techniques. Its focus is on how accountability requirements manifest in daily workplace practice, and what that means for technologies operating in this space.

Introduction
-----------------

Background (Recap of relevant literature)
---------------------------------------------------

Study scope and method details
----------------------------------
Outlines the fieldwork, as well as giving some relevant details of the setting, discussing specific methods such as data collection, nature of field visits, activities engaged in, details of fieldwork diaries, interview details.

Findings
-----------------

### Money and Spending
Outlines how money is acquired, organised, and spent within the organisation. Attention is paid to money's flow around a system, as well as how that system is embodied in the actions of the workers in the charity. Contains detials of accounting, and producing accounts.

### Reporting on Activity and Outcomes
Outlines how "productive work" is performed in the organisation, as well as how this is accounted for. Social Media is discussed as a technology, as well as the use of pictures and other contextual information that is designed to produce narratives.

### Accountability In-The-Moment
Discusses aspects of producing accountability that happen on-the-fly without any formal reporting mechanism, such as how trustees can understand what's happening within the organisation at a glance.

### Hidden Work (Reproductive Labour)
Discusses aspects of the organisation's work that is otherwise hidden from view. Differs from the previous section in scope as this specifically pertains to work practices of the organisation that are required to reproduce the organisation itself, and not necessarily related to an embodied in-the-moment accountability.

Discussion
-----------------

### Matching Accountability with Accountability of Work Practice
This section discusses the notion of accountability in the context with the work practice accountability definition understood by HCI and CSCW fields

### Solve et Coagula: Supporting a Configurable Transparency
This section discusses the design requirement that a Configurable transaprency must be supported to better produce accountability for the organisation

### Proposing Linked Data to create Contexts
This section proposes linked data solutions as a means to producing the characteristics outlines above.
