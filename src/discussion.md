We can't design away their wealth: Reflections on the Digital Civics programme
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ Introduce original framing of digital civics re the "relational" model of services
+ this design work is definitely valuable but the performance of the programme also had embedded values
+ Takes austerity for granted as the state of play
+ some of the engagements framed as digital civics don't even acknowledge privatisation of public services (ie the parks and park learn)
+ design work here therefore adds a veneer to neoliberalism (*"silicon valley localism"* might be a good term here)
+ my work even plays to this tune; heralding open data as producing this dialectic form of transparency and laying the groundwork for a "relational" model of transparency.
+ when actually the problem is that charities are being increasingly marketised and forcibily reformed into "social enterprise" which is capital's appropriation of charitable work.
+ where social enterprises operate for "public good"; why is the state not doing that?
+ Where is the citizen's "relationship" with a state that is increasingly absent?
+ Relational models as originally presented in Digital Civics ultimately dress up austerity as "making the best use of resources", ignoring the fact that service provision (especially local infrastructure) *is* a relationship between the state and its citizens.
+ Some of digital civics work has been emblematic of that; small engagements in interesting and valuable spaces that are crying out for resources.  This entices them into participating in our research and allows us to "configure" that participation to our advantage without actually seeking affecting change. There are notable exceptions to this (Strohmayer + NUM, Bellini + perpetrators, Janis + collaborators, ) which demonstrate the power of those with resources (academics,researchers) extending these resources to those without (their collaborators).
+ The power of design research here is not in results of design work, although the value of that should not be disavowed, but in the *performance of genuine engagement*.
+ My contemporaries I've named do not (yet) appear to explicitly situate their work as *struggle*, but I contend that these engagements/collaborations are examples of Digitial Civics done right
+ Digital Civics as design work; without this act of struggle it is apologism for the values designed into our society.
+ We can do all of the design work in the world -- we can release open data, produce boundary objects or digital toolkits, and work with charities but without a deeper engagement with the *why* we're doing this -- not just the lip service of designing in a previously unexplored space but why we're being forced into a position *where we have to do this* -- nothing will change.
+ At the end of the day Patchwork are still a charity amelerioating the neglect of Benwell, which contains people in genuine need. Those truly with the capital and resources are not interested. We can't design away their wealth.
