Responsibility plays a significant role in mediating Accountability relationships with organisations within the TSSE. Many States such as the UK and the USA enforce legal requirements on charities that they fulfil particular obligations with regards to reporting; which is generally done in the name of Transparency and/or Accountability. The protected status of the term 'Charity' in UK law also further ties the reporting Responsibilities of the organisations to the organisation's legal status.

In the UK, Charities are responsible to abide by the frameworks set out by a branch of Government known as the Charity Commission.

It is important to note Koppell's framework describes *Responsibility* as not just adherence to legal frameworks, but to the professional standards of conduct as well. Funders will often expect reports to be made
