=========================================

This chapter presents an empirical account of the design process that was undertaken in order to produce software that was later deployed. In addition to this, a technical overview of the software is also presented.

Introduction

Background (Recap of relevant literature)
------------------------------------------------

Study Scope and Methods
--------------------------------
This section elaborates on the overall design process following the initial portion of fieldwork. The design process is discussed in detail with reference to literature used to ground the specific techniques used.

### Initial Design Work

#### Futures Workshop

### Iterative Development and Design


Technical Specifications
--------------------------------
This section outlines the technical specifications of the software that was developed for deployment later. Attention is spent on its federated architecture, and the two main components of the system are discussed.

### Overview

#### Federated Architecture

### Accounting Scrapbook

### Rosemary Accounts

### Discarded Designs

Discussion
----------------
This section reflects on features and discussions in the design process in order to contribute to teh design requirements of software in this space. In addition to this, comments are made on the appropriateness of techniques utilised develop the designs in this setting.

### Building metaphors
