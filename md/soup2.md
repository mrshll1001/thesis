The terms Accountability and Transparency are so intertwined that the two are often used interchangeably [@fox_uncertain_2007, @hood_accountability_2010]. They are, however, separate and the relationship between the two terms is often more complex than the direct causal relationship of "Transparency creates Accountability" implied by common usage of the terms. Ahneier and Hawkes note that Accountability in particular is a "multi-dimensional concept that requires unpacking before it becomes useful as a policy concept and management tool"; Accountability itself is a problem and not simply a solution one can apply [@anheier_accountability_2009].

Koppel avoids trying to produce a definitive definition of Accountability, stating "[to layer] every imagined meaning of accountability into a single definition would render the concept meaningless" [@koppell_pathologies_2005]. Instead, Koppell imbues Accountability with a 5-part typology to facilitate discussion of the term.  Transparency features prominently in the typology, with Koppell referring to it as one of the "foundations, supporting notions that underpin accountability in all of its manifestations" alongside *Liability* [@koppell_pathologies_2005]. Liability here, is defined as the attachment of consequences to performance and culpability to Transparency -- punishing organisations or individuals for failure, and rewarding them for successes [@koppell_pathologies_2005]. These 'foundational' elements of Accountability are explored further by Fox who discusses Accountability in terms of "the capacity or right to demand answers" or the "capacity to sanction" [@fox_uncertain_2007]. Fox puts forward that while Transparency is concerned with the right or ability to access information and thus required for Accountability; the common assumption that the former generates the latter is challenged when held to scrutiny [@fox_uncertain_2007]. Fox instead asks the question of how different forms of Transparency contribute to different forms of Accountability.

Fox delineates two forms of Transparency; *Clear* and *Fuzzy* which resemble the distinctions made by Oliver and Schauer discussed earlier [@fox_uncertain_2007, @oliver_what_2004, @schauer_transparency_2011]. Fox argues the importance of this distinction lies in the fact that as Transparency becomes an increasingly desirable term, its opponents will express dissent through provision of *Fuzzy Transparency*. This is data which lacks information that can reveal organisational behaviour and thus cannot be used to generate Accountability [@fox_uncertain_2007]. Conversely, the *Clear Transparency* is described as such things as  "information-access policies [and] programmes that reveal reliable information about institutional performance, specifying officials' responsibilities [and] where public funds go". Importantly, though *Clear Transparency* is concerned with organisational behaviour, it is not sufficient to generate accountability -- which requires the intervention of other actors [@fox_uncertain_2007]. Accountability itself may be either *Soft* or *Hard* according to Fox. *Soft Accountability* denotes the ability to demand answers, whereas *Hard Accountability* describes an actor's ability to issue sanctions to an organisation. Fox puts forward that appropriate amounts of *Clear Transparency* may generate a form of *Soft Accountability* called *Answerability* where a stakeholder may demand answers, but that Transparency by itself is not enough to support actions such as sanctioning, which require the ability to investigate and produce information about organisational behaviour [@fox_uncertain_2007]. In this, Fox's analysis of Accountability explores more deeply the connections between Transparency and Accountability, and supports Koppell's description of *Liability* as the second foundational element of Accountability.

The remaining three elements of Koppell's typology: *Controllability*; *Responsibility*; and *Responsiveness* are all built upon these two foundations. Koppell defines *Controllability* as being present where "X can induce the behaviour of Y [then] Y is accountable to X" [@koppell_pathologies_2005]. Koppell notes that *Controllability* may be difficult in organisations that have multiple stakeholders whom it is supposed to be controlled by, but the typology is unclear as to which physical mechanisms may be employed to control behaviour. Romzek and Dubnick describe systems of Accountability such as internal *Bureaucratic* procedures and external *Legal* systems being utilised to control actions [@romzek_accountability_1987], which fit into Koppell's typology underneath *Responsibility*; the constraint of behaviour through laws, riles, or norms such as legal frameworks and professional standards. A notable example of this in UK law would be the Charity Commission, which enforces the production of accounts and report data by organisations to maintain their legal status as a Charity under the law [@hm_government_charity_nodate]. In addition to this, funding organisations (both governmental and philanthropic) have Accountability expectations, generally taking the form of reports on action and use of funds which are produced for the funder by the organisation in receipt of funds, embodying the *Bureaucratic* systems discussed by Romzek and Dubnick [@dhanani_accountability_2009, @yang_accountability_2017, @romzek_accountability_1987]. Anheier and Hawkes level criticism at these Transparency measures, stating that they cannot be used to generate true Accountability as it is often media companies that reveal organisational behaviour to the public rather than auditing bodies [@anheier_accountability_2009]. A recent example of this in the UK would be how the charity *Kids Company* experienced negative media coverage over their closure related to alleged misuse of funds [@elgot_kids_2015].

The final element of the typology is *Responsiveness*; an organisation's attention to the needs of its beneficiaries  as opposed to following hierarchical orders [@koppell_pathologies_2005]. This is also described by Romzek and Dubnick as *Political* Accountability, describing the relationship between someone holding a political office and their constituents [@romzek_accountability_1987]. This is arguably the most important form of Accountability for organisations such as Charities and the TSSE as the nature of their work is, as discussed, sensitive and of critical importance to matters such as Social Capital and Health CITE ME. The relationship between Transparency and Accountability is again forefronted as what is institutionalised as 'Transparency' (through bureaucratic and legal pathways) may not be understandable to many beneficiaries [@schauer_transparency_2011].
