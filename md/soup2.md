The terms Accountability and Transparency are so intertwined that the two are often used interchangeably [@fox_uncertain_2007, @hood_accountability_2010]. They are, however, separate and the relationship between the two terms is often more complex than the direct causal relationship of "Transparency creates Accountability" implied by common usage of the terms. Ahneier and Hawkes note that Accountability in particular is a "multi-dimensional concept that requires unpacking before it becomes useful as a policy concept and management tool"; Accountability itself is a problem and not simply a solution one can apply [@anheier_accountability_2009].

Koppel avoids trying to produce a definitive definition of Accountability, stating "[to layer] every imagined meaning of accountability into a single definition would render the concept meaningless" [@koppell_pathologies_2005]. Instead, Koppell imbues Accountability with a 5-part typology to facilitate discussion of the term.  Transparency features prominently in the typology, with Koppell referring to it as one of the "foundations, supporting notions that underpin accountability in all of its manifestations" alongside *Liability* [@koppell_pathologies_2005]. Liability here, is defined as the attachment of consequences to performance and culpability to Transparency -- punishing organisations or individuals for failure, and rewarding them for successes [@koppell_pathologies_2005]. These 'foundational' elements of Accountability are explored further by Fox who discusses Accountability in terms of "the capacity or right to demand answers" or the "capacity to sanction" [@fox_uncertain_2007]. Fox puts forward that while Transparency is concerned with the right or ability to access information and thus required for Accountability; the common assumption that the former generates the latter is challenged when held to scrutiny [@fox_uncertain_2007]. Fox instead asks the question of how different forms of Transparency contribute to different forms of Accountability.

Fox delineates two forms of Transparency; *Clear* and *Fuzzy* which resemble the distinctions made by Oliver and Schauer discussed earlier [@fox_uncertain_2007, @oliver_what_2004, @schauer_transparency_2011]. Fox argues the importance of this distinction lies in the fact that as Transparency becomes an increasingly desirable term, its opponents will express dissent through provision of *Fuzzy Transparency*. This is data which lacks information that can reveal organisational behaviour and thus cannot be used to generate Accountability [@fox_uncertain_2007]. Conversely, the *Clear Transparency* is described as such things as  "information-access policies [and] programmes that reveal reliable information about institutional performance, specifying officials' responsibilities [and] where public funds go". Importantly, though *Clear Transparency* is concerned with organisational behaviour, it is not sufficient to generate accountability -- which requires the intervention of other actors [@fox_uncertain_2007]. Accountability itself may be either *Soft* or *Hard* according to Fox. *Soft Accountability* denotes the ability to demand answers, whereas *Hard Accountability* describes an actor's ability to issue sanctions to an organisation. Fox puts forward that appropriate amounts of *Clear Transparency* may generate a form of *Soft Accountability* called *Answerability* where a stakeholder may demand answers, but that Transparency by itself is not enough to support actions such as sanctioning, which require the ability to investigate and produce information about organisational behaviour [@fox_uncertain_2007]. In this, Fox's analysis of Accountability explores more deeply the connections between Transparency and Accountability, and supports Koppell's description of *Liability* as the second foundational element of Accountability.

The remaining three elements of Koppell's typology: *Controllability*; *Responsibility*; and *Responsiveness* are all built upon these two foundations. Koppell defines *Controllability* as being present where "X can induce the behaviour of Y [then] Y is accountable to X" [@koppell_pathologies_2005]. Koppell notes that *Controllability* may be difficult in organisations that have multiple stakeholders whom it is supposed to be controlled by, but the typology is unclear as to which physical mechanisms may be employed to control behaviour. Romzek and Dubnick describe systems of Accountability such as internal *Bureaucratic* procedures and external *Legal* systems being utilised to control actions [@romzek_accountability_1987], which fit into Koppell's typology underneath *Responsibility*; the constraint of behaviour through laws, riles, or norms such as legal frameworks and professional standards. A notable example of this in UK law would be the Charity Commission, which enforces the production of accounts and report data by organisations to maintain their legal status as a Charity under the law [@hm_government_charity_nodate]. In addition to this, funding organisations (both governmental and philanthropic) have Accountability expectations, generally taking the form of reports on action and use of funds which are produced for the funder by the organisation in receipt of funds, embodying the *Bureaucratic* systems discussed by Romzek and Dubnick [@dhanani_accountability_2009, @yang_accountability_2017, @romzek_accountability_1987]. Anheier and Hawkes level criticism at these Transparency measures, stating that they cannot be used to generate true Accountability as it is often media companies that reveal organisational behaviour to the public rather than auditing bodies [@anheier_accountability_2009]. A recent example of this in the UK would be how the charity *Kids Company* experienced negative media coverage over their closure related to alleged misuse of funds [@elgot_kids_2015]. Additional criticism comes at the performance management aspect of these Bureaucratic systems that seek to make organisations by measuring organisation performance. Lowe and Wilson note that when forced to adhere to *"Outcomes-based Performance Management"* (OBPM) **EXPLAIN**, organisations will tailor their reporting to ensure that they appear to match the outcomes -- effectively trying to 'game' the system @lowe_playing_2015. Lowe argues that this is due to the emergent nature of outcomes from complex systems, and that organisations within the TSSE thus cannot be responsible for *"delivering"* the outcomes they are measured against @lowe_new_2013. Lowe also puts forward that the act of measuring outcomes loses focus on the impact of that outcome on a person experiencing it, and the use of outcomes as a performance management tools for organisations is itself paradoxical @lowe_new_2013. The focus on people and beneficiaries forms the *Responsiveness* element of Koppell's typology.

*Responsiveness*; an organisation's attention to the needs of its beneficiaries and impact on their lives as opposed to following hierarchical orders [@koppell_pathologies_2005]. This is also described by Romzek and Dubnick as *Political* Accountability, describing the relationship between someone holding a political office and their constituents [@romzek_accountability_1987]. This is arguably the most important form of Accountability for organisations such as Charities and the TSSE as the nature of their work is, as discussed, sensitive and of critical importance to matters such as Social Capital and Health @CITEMEs. The relationship between Transparency and Accountability is again forefronted since the forms of Transparency institutionalised through bureaucratic and legal pathways may not be understandable to beneficiaries unless they possess the skills to interpret or interrogate the information @schauer_transparency_2011.

Koppell writes that because of the different forms of Accountability, determining that an organisation is Accountable is dependant on which dimension of Accountability one has in mind @koppell_pathologies_2005. Due to the lack of differentiating Accountability's various forms this can lead to tensions as organisations are expected to be "accountable" in every sense by different actors and stakeholders which may often be contradictory. Koppell discusses this occurrence as *"Multiple Accountabilities Disorder"* (MAD); where organisations are subjected to various conflicting pressures design to make them "accountable" @koppell_pathologies_2005. OBPM as discussed provides example of this conflict -- as charities and TSSEs are required to expend effort reporting on outcomes that lose the focus on how their beneficiaries experience their work @lowe_new_2013, @lowe_playing_2015; whilst at the same time being responsive to their needs which may not match the outcomes dictated by reporting structures.

**TECH AS WHITE SAVIOUR CONCLUSION**
+ We can see that transparency is an integral part of navigating accountability, and thus has the potential to mediate relationships between an organisation and various stakeholders -- and that various forms of transparency can produce various forms of accountability. This can lead to tensions which we can see in examples of how transparency measures can influence organisational behaviour
+ Transparency and production of information is increasingly been done via digital technology, but generally takes the form of reproducing the systems that are already in place
+ Digital technologies can be built with embedded values and therefore can be designed in such a way that they instead challenge the mechanisms of producing transparency that lead to tensions, or make it easier for an organisation to manage their accountabilities to multiple stakeholders.s
